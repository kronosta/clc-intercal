   0  COMMENT      '%' ['invalid statement']
		   This error code is used by the compiler when it does
		   not have a more appropriate error code. If you try to
		   execute the statement, the error message will be the
		   statement itself.
   1  TODO         'Not implemented: %' ['description']
		   The requested compiler or runtime feature has not
		   been written.
   4  ROMAN        'Unknown read type for Roman numerals: %' ['type']
		   The compiler attempted to specify an invalid default
		   representation for Roman numerals. Numeric output
		   cannot work.
   5  SPOT         '% des not look like a one spot value' ['number']
		   A special register expected a spot value and got this
		   instead.
   6  INVSPEC      'Invalid value % for special register' ['number']
		   Attempt to assign something to a special register,
		   but the register didn't like it.
   8  BASE         'Base must be between 2 and 7 (got %)' ['base']
		   The program assigned an invalid value to %BA
   9  IOTYPE       'Invalid I/O Type: %' ['type']
		   The compiler attempted to set the default input/output
		   mechanism (usually one of CLC or C). Binary and
		   alphanumeric I/O cannot work.
  10  CHARSET      'Invalid character set: %' ['name']
		   The compiler attempted to set an invalid default
		   character set. Try using one of ASCII, Baudot, EBCDIC
		   or Hollerith.
  69  INVALID      'Invalid bytecode (%) for %' ['code' 'item']
		   An expression or overload contains bytecode designed for
		   use in statements; or conversely a statement contains
		   an expression bytecode where the interpreter doesn't
		   expect it.
  70  REGNUM       'Invalid register number "%"' ['register']
		   The program used something like I<.0> or I<.65536>. Note
		   that this may be an unintentional consequence of assigning
		   to a constant.
 109  NOSUCHCHAR   'Invalid character (%) for %' ['code' 'charset']
		   The conversion between character sets just could not
		   cope with this. This splat is currently generated when
		   converting to Baudot or Hollerith, when a character does
		   not exist in that character set; or when converting from
		   Hollerith when an overpunch just cannot be represented.
 123  NEXTING      'Program attempted more than % levels of NEXTing' ['number']
		   INTERCAL programs aren't supposed to do that.
 128  JUNK         'Cannot use JUNK in this grammar' []
		   A grammar used the special predefined symbol JUNK but
		   did not provide enough evidence that it knows what to
		   do with it.
 129  NOSUCHLABEL  'Could not find label %' ['label']
		   A NEXT or STUDY refers to an undefined label.
 130  TOOMANYLABS  'Cannot decide between % instances of label %' ['number' 'label']
		   A NEXT or STUDY refers to a label which is multiply
		   defined. This may be an unintended effect of using
		   computed labels.
 131  INVLABEL     'Invalid label %' ['label']
		   A NEXT or STUDY refers to a label which is not valid,
		   for example zero or too large.
 241  NODIM        'Array not dimensioned' []
		   Subscripts have been applied to an array register which
		   has not been dimensioned; or they have been applied to
		   a non-array register.
 242  NOTCLASS     'Non-class value used as class' []
		   A number or array was used where a class would be better.
 243  ISARRAY      'Array register used as value' []
		   An array was used where a number would be more appropriate.
 244  ISCLASS      'Class register used as value' []
		   A value was assigned to a class register, or a class
		   register was used for arithmetic.
 245  NOARRAY      'Non-array register used as array' []
		   A non-array register (or a simple value) was used where
		   the system would like an array.
 247  SPECIAL      'Attempt to use special register %' ['name']
		   The given special register does not accept assignments.
		   This may indicate a bug in CLC-INTERCAL.
 248  ISSPECIAL    'Attempt to use special register as number' []
		   The special type indicator from a special register has
		   leaked to places where we expect a number. This is very
		   likely to be a bug in CLC-INTERCAL.
 249  DIVERSION    'Invalid diversion: % is % %' ['label', 'problem', 'label']
		   The region specified for a road closure or a diversion is
		   not valid: the two labels exist, but they cannot be used to
		   delimit a region.
 250  NOCLASS      'Invalid value % assigned to class' ['value']
		   The program assigned a value to a class register. This
		   is not a good idea.
 251  INVARRAY     'Invalid value in array element: %' ['reason']
		   An array is being created, but assignment to one of its
		   elements provided an invalid value, such as another array.
 252  OVREG        'Cannot use overload register %' ['name']
		   The overload register can only be used to find which other
		   register it belongs to, and that only during overloading.
		   Any other use is forbidden.
 253  INVCLASS     'Invalid lecture: %' ['reason']
		   A lecture is being defined (e.g. by STUDY) but something
		   went wrong.
 254  CLASS        'Invalid subject: %' ['reason']
		   Class registers can be used only in special ways. This
		   wasn't one of them.
 256  NOVALUE      'This register cannot hold a value' []
		   You may be wondering what's for...
 257  NOSPECIAL    'Normal register used as special' []
		   Somehow the program managed to use a normal register
		   (spot, two spot, tail, hybrid, whirlpool) as a special
		   (double-oh-seven, shark fin). May indicate a compiler bug.
 274  SPOTS        'Number % too large for %' ['value' 'number of spots']
		   An arithmetic calculation intended for the given number
		   of spots resulted in a number too large to fit there.
 276  SUBSCRIPT    'Invalid subscript %: %' ['value' 'reason']
		   A subscript is out of range, for example greater than
		   the size of the array, or zero.
 277  ASSIGN       'Impossible assignment (base %): cannot find #X such that #%X is #%' ['base' 'operation' 'result']
		   Assigning to a unary operator is sometimes impossible.
 279  SUBSIZE      'Invalid number of subscripts: % provided, % required' ['number' 'number']
		   The number of subscripts supplied to an array is wrong.
 280  ARRAY        'Invalid array: %' ['reason']
		   Program attempted to create an array (for example by
		   dimensioning a tail or hybrid register) but something
		   went wrong.
 281  NUMBER       'Invalid number: %' ['reason']
		   The program attempted to use something weird where a
		   number would have been a good idea instead.
 315  SUBVERSION   'Program trying to subvert natural order' []
		   The program attempted to install a diversion which overlaps its
		   own road closure. This is not permitted.
 369  NOTHREAD     'Thread % does not exist' ['thread ID']
		   An attempt was made to duplicate or kill a thread which
		   does not exist; it may have already terminated or maybe
		   it was never created.
 398  CONTEXT      'Invalid context: %' ['explanation']
		   Something was used in the wrong place.
 432  READ         'Not suitable for %' ['operation']
		   The program attempted to READ OUT or WRITE IN something which
		   is not suitable for I/O. You can use numbers, arrays or
		   classes but this was none of the above.
 433  REGISTER     'Not a valid register: %' ['register']
		   The program used something hoping it would work as a register.
		   It didn't.
 436  HIDDEN       'Register % stashed away too well' ['name']
		   The program RETRIEVEd more than it SHASHed.
 437  NOREGISTER   'Cannot % numbers' ['operation']
		   The program attempted to STASH or RETRIEVE a number rather
		   than a register. This may be an unintended effect of
		   overloading.
 438  ISNUMBER     'Numbers cannot %' ['operation']
		   The program did something like #1 LEARNS or #2 GRADUATES.
		   In other words, a number was used where one would like
		   a register. This may be an unintended effect of overloading.
 444  CONVERT      'Cannot convert % to %' ['opcode' 'opcode']
		   The two opcodes are not compatible; it won't work.
 445  SWAP         'Cannot swap % and %' ['opcode' 'opcode']
		   The two opcodes are not compatible; it won't work.
 456  SPLAT        'No splat' []
		   Program used the splat (*) operator to find out the code
		   of the last splat, but the program hasn't splatted yet.
 457  INVSPLAT     'Invalid splat %' ['number']
		   Invalid splat. This is likely to happen when you assign to
		   the '*' expression.
 511  INDEPENDENT  'Register % does not belong to anything' ['name']
		   The program applied a belonging path to a register which did
		   not belong to anything.
 512  NOBELONG     'Register % does not belong to register %' ['register' 'group']
		   The program attempted to MAKE a register NO LONGER BELONG to
		   another, but it didn't belong in the first place.
 513  NOSUCHBELONG 'Register % does not belong to % registers (just %)' ['name' 'number' 'number']
		   The program requested the n-th register this one belongs
		   to, but it does not belong to that many groups.
 514  INVBELONG    'Invalid belong number: %' ['value']
		   The program requested an invalid belong number, probably zero.
 534  DIGITS       'Wrong number of digits for base %: %' ['base' 'number']
		   An arithmetic calculation in the specified base resulted
		   in a number with too many digits.
 535  SYMBOL       'Invalid symbol: %' ['name']
		   The program used I<name> as a symbol, but this is not OK.
 555  COMEFROM     'Multiple "COME FROM" %' ['label']
		   The program has multiple COME FROMs all pointing at the
		   same statement, and multithreading is disabled. This splat
		   is also very likely to happen if "come from gerund" is
		   enabled and multithreading is disabled.
 578  BCMATCH      'Invalid bytecode pattern in %: %' ['name' 'problem']
		   A bytecode pattern specified in an optimiser contained
		   a problem.
 603  CLASSWAR     'Class war between % and %' ['class' 'class']
		   Two classes teach the same subject and a register is
		   enrolled in both. Can't decide which lecture to use.
 621  NORESUME     'Pointless RESUME' []
		   A program attempted to RESUME #0.
 632  RESUME       'Program terminated via RESUME' []
		   A program RESUMEd more than NEXTed.
 633  FALL_OFF     'Falling off the edge of the program' []
		   The program tried to execute past its end. Try adding
		   a PLEASE GIVE UP somewhere.
 634  INTERNAL     'Internal error: %' ['explanation']
		   The unthinkable happened and there appears to be
		   a bug in CLC-INTERCAL. Probably an illusion but do
		   submit a bug report. Include your program (if not
		   too embarrassed) and the precise text of the error
		   message (it does contain clues to the developers);
		   also include any other useful information, including,
		   but not limited to, compiler options used, perversion
		   of CLC-INTERCAL, any patches and/or modifications
		   you have applied to the compiler, and what colour was
		   selected by the system to display the error message.
 635  UNDOCUMENTED 'No such undocumented % as %' ['what', 'name']
		   An extension used one of the various undocumented opcodes
		   to ask for something, but the something didn't appear to
		   exist. This is likely to be a bug in the extension, maybe
		   it didn't load the appropriate module. Refer to the online
		   documentation for a full description of undocumented
		   opcodes (so they aren't actually undocumented!)
 636  INVUNDOC     'Invalid undocumented operation (%): %s' ['name', 'reason']
		   An extension used one of the various undocumented opcodes
		   but did something wrong or unsupported with it.
 641  IOMODE       'Invalid I/O mode %' ['mode']
		   Program attempted to open a filehandle using a silly code
		   for the I/O mode. It won't work.
 642  IOERR        'Input output error in %: %' ['file' 'error']
		   Something bad happened.
 643  SEEKERR      'Seek/tell error: %' ['problem']
		   You shouldn't have done that.
 644  MODEERR      'I/O error: %' ['problem']
		   You shouldn't have done that.
 660  NOSYSCALL    'Undefined system call %' ['number']
		   Program made a system call but the system did not
		   know what to do about it.
 661  SYSCALL      'Missing system call number' []
		   Program attempted to make a system call but did not
		   provide a system call number.
 662  DIVIDE       'Unary division by zero' []
		   Program attempted unary division by zero.
 664  INDIGESTION  'Program is too large' []
		   Either the source or the comnpiled code exceeded some
		   built-in arbitrary limits.
 665  HEADSPIN     'Confused by your diversions, my head is spinning' []
		   There is something not quite right with your road closures,
		   or maybe you tried to remove a diversion which wasn't there.
 666  QUANTUM      '% does not have a quantum version' ['statement']
		   Program attempted to run a statement in quantum mode,
		   but the statement cannot do that. This is likely to
		   be either a READ OUT (because it is observable) or
		   a WHILE (because it does not have a Quantum version).
 699  LECTURE      'Not in a lecture' []
		   Cannot FINISH LECTURE unless there is one.
 700  LANGUAGE     'Invalid language: %' ['language']
		   The compiler does not know about that language. Try
		   something more standard, such as Scottish Gaelic.
 701  NONUMBER     'Value written in is not a number: %' ['value']
		   You typed something like ZERRO instead of ZERO. Or
		   perhaps you used a language which is not understood
		   by CLC-INTERCAL.
 702  THREESPOT    'Value written in is larger than two spots' []
		   You typed too many digits.
 703  NODATA       'End of file encountered when writing an array in' []
		   It helps if there is some input.
 742  OSERR        '%' ['error']
		   Something bad happened; this will show the error message
		   from the operating system.
 751  EVENT        'Invalid event: BODY WHILE CONDITION' []
		   Before you can use it you must CONVERT it to a
		   CONDITION WHILE BODY (or you must SWAP them).
 752  NOASSIGN     'Cannot assign %: %' ['value' 'reason']
		   The program attempted to assign an invalid value to
		   a register.
 774  BUG          'Compiler error' []
		   Program encountered a compiler error.
 775  UBUG         'Unexplainable compiler error' []
		   Program encountered a compiler error, even though the
		   "compiler error" has been disabled by a compiler option.
 796  FORBIDDEN    '% is forbidden in INTERCAL-1972' ['operation']
		   You asked for a compiler compatible with INTERCAL-1972
		   but used some extensions, such as binary I/O. Select
		   CLC-INTERCAL native mode or compatibility with C-INTERCAL
		   to use these things.
 799  HOLIDAY      'No class teaches subjects %' ['number']
		   Maybe it's some kind of holiday?
 815  EVOLUTION    'Creation not allowed: %' ['reason']
		   A CREATE (or DESTROY) statement attempted something illegal.
 816  CREATION     'CREATE statement misconfiguration: %' ['reason']
		   The production contained some invalid code.
 818  CIRCULAR     'Circular reasoning in %' ['symbol']
		   Recursion is acceptable, but here the problem is that
		   the symbol is defined as being identical to itself,
		   which is true but not useful.
 822  NOSTUDENT    'Register % is not a student' ['name']
		   The program attempted to LEARN something, but the
		   register has not enrolled in a class.
 823  NOCURRICULUM 'Subject % is not in %\'s curriculum' ['number' 'register']
		   Program attempted to LEARN something, but the register
		   is not in the right class.
 899  INTERNET     'INTERcal NETwork error talking to %: %' ['server' 'error']
		   A problem was encountered while talking to a theft server.
# 900 to 902 are reserved for the INTERcal NETworking (INTERNET) extension
 997  ILLEGAL      'Illegal operator % for base %' ['name' 'base']
		   Maybe you forgot to include the appropriate compiler option
		   for the correct base? Or used the wrong suffix? Or you
		   overloaded the base and so can't tell what base you are using
		   for calculations?
 998  LATE         'Too late to run this program' []
		   The program's state cannot be saved because the year is
		   2,510,588,971,096,165 or later and the file format does not
		   allow storing a number large enough.  Did you forget to
		   upgrade your compiler?  See issue 14.
 999  EARLY        'Lecture at % is too early' ['label']
		   Program attempted to define a lecture before 1000.
		   That's way too early.
