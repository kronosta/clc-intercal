Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.2 to 1.-94.-2.3

* Fixed a crash when data arrived before the program was ready to
  received it. This could happen for example with a multiline paste.

* Updated Makefile.PL for the build system changes

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1 to 1.-94.-2.2

* Updated test 00use.t to match changes in Base package

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2 to 1.-94.-2.1

* Added a test that ReadLine has initialised correctly and is not trying
  to fall back to a dumb version, which is currently not supported and
  would cause a runtime error later. Now the interface will refuse to
  start and the caller (usually intercalc) can fall back to the next one
  in the list.

* Added a configuration file, UI-Line.sickrc, to register this interface
  when it is installe.

* Changed t/00use.t to use Language::INTERCAL::Distribute

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-3 to 1.-94.-2

* Created a new package with the "Line" user interface.
