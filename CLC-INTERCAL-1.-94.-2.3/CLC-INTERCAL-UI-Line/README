CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.3 -- Line-oriented text interface

This package extends the standard "batch mode" interface to CLC-INTERCAL
with command-line editing, command history and command completion.
At present, only the INTERCAL calculator, "intercalc", uses this interface,
although a future release of "sick" will be able to use it as well.

CLC-INTERCAL Base 1.-94.-2.3 or newer must be installed before this
package.

To install, run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Note that Term::ReadLine and Term::ReadLine::Gnu are required by this
interface. Term::ReadLine::Perl is not supported at present. Makefile.PL
will print a warning if it cannot find Term::ReadLine::Gnu.
