CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.3 -- Full screen text interface

This package installs a full-screen text user interface to CLC-INTERCAL.
At present, only the INTERCAL calculator, "intercalc", uses this interface,
although a future release of "sick" will be able to use it as well.

CLC-INTERCAL Base 1.-94.-2.3 or newer must be installed before this
package.

To install, run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Note that Curses.pm must be installed for this interface to work. Makefile.PL
will warn you if it cannot find a usable Curses.pm
