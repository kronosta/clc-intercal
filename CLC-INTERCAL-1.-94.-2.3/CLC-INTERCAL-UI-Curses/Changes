Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.2 to 1.-94.-2.3

* Updated Makefile.PL for the build system changes

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1 to 1.-94.-2.2

* Updated test 00use.t to match changes in Base package

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2 to 1.-94.-2.1

* Added support for mouse where possible: system curses library supports it,
  the program is running in an environment where the mouse can be used etc.

* Substantial update of the UI-Curses code with many parts rewritten:

  * New window border code to get a better result on the screen.

  * Added detection of resize events. If the Curses module already knows how
    to do that, take advantage of it, otherwise use a SIGWINCH handler.

  * Improved support for utf8 standard I/O, if Curses is able to detect it.

  * Improved navigation of keypad and menus with cursor keys, including the
    ability to access menus if the Alt-key combination doesn't work in a
    particular environment.

  * Overhaul of the window open/close code to make it more robust.

* Added a better test to see if the terminal is suitable for a Curses
  program. If not, the caller (usually intercalc) will try the next
  available interface.

* Added a new system configuration file, UI-Curses.sickrc, to register the
  Courses interface.

* Changed t/00use.t to use Language::INTERCAL::Distribute

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-3 to 1.-94.-2

* Created a new package with the "Curses" user interface.
