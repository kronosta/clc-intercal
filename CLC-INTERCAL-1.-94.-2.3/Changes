Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.2 to 1.-94.-2.3

* Updated the VIM syntax highlighting module to know about the new
  statements introduced recently, and generally to get better results.

* Also see */Changes

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1 to 1.-94.-2.2

* Serious performance improvements: see CLC-INTERCAL-Base/Changes for
  details of all the work. It's still obviously interpreted rather than
  compiler, but we are working on that too.

* Corrected version numbers on a lot of files: they were present in
  comments or as assignment to $PERVERSION but many had an incorrect
  format; also, changed t/00use.t to check the format in more files

* Also see */Changes

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2 to 1.-94.-2.1

* Split the sickrc between modules, so that Base no longer need to know
  what may be installed later needing configuration.

* Added the a new planned extension mechanism for the language; this is
  in addition to the "Undocumented opcode" mechanism which is of course
  fully documented.

* Moved all the INTERNET related stuff to INET using the new extension
  mechanism, with the exception of Server which is used by Base (the
  system call interface can open TCP sockets).

* Updated URLs and other things which referred to old servers which we
  no longer use.

* New README.md (the original README renamed README.original)

* Somewhat simplified Makefile.PL and also allowed to build from either
  the bundle of tarballs (as 1.-94.-2 required) or the unpacked directories
  (as the git repository provides)

* Added a directory of "bonus" stuff which was not part of the distribution
  but may be of interest.  The first item in there is a DD/SH script to
  implement INTERCAL unary and binary operations, obviously a must for any
  shell programmer.

* Changed the top-level "make test" to run all tests directly rather than
  calling each subdirectory recursively: this provides an easier to read
  summary of all tests; calling "make test" from a subdirectory still works
  and runs only the tests for that subdirectory.

* Changes specific to just a single part are listed be in */Changes

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-3 to 1.-94.-2

* The package has been split into various parts. See the various
  "Changes" in there.
