	<H2><A NAME="constants">Constants</A></H2>

	<P>
	Constants are simply the symbol <CODE>#</CODE> (mesh) followed by an integer
	between 0 and 65535. For example <CODE>#1</CODE>, <CODE>#65535</CODE>.
	</P>

	<P>
	To create 32 bit constants, use the interleave operator
	(see <A HREF="#binary">binary operators</A> below).
	For example, <CODE>#256&#162;#0</CODE> has value 65536, and
	<CODE>#65535&#162;#65535</CODE> has value 4294967295.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="variables">Variables</A></H2>

	<P>
	Variables are represented by up to four pieces of information:
	<UL>
	    <LI>The belonging path. This part is optional.
	    <LI>The variable identifier, as described below.
	    <LI>The variable number, an integer between 1 and 65535.
	    <LI>Subscripts. This part must not be included if the variable is not an
	    array. If you are trying to extract a value, this part must be present
	    when the variable is an array register. If you just want to name a
	    register, always leave it out.
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	The belonging path is a simple way to follow the BELONGS TO relationship
	between registers. Prefixing a register with big-money (<CODE>$</CODE>)
	will take you to the register this one belongs to. Prefixing with a digit
	from 2 to 9 will take you to the corresponding secondary belonging. For
	more information, see <A HREF="belongs.html">the chapter on Belongs TO</A>.
	Note that belonging paths cannot be used if the compiler is <I>ick</I>,
	as the big-money is used for interleave.
	</P>

	<P>
	The variable identifier defines the variable type. There are six types:
	<UL>
	    <LI>One spot (<CODE>.</CODE>) - these can contain 16 bit values.
	    <LI>Two spots (<CODE>:</CODE>) - these can contain 32 bit values.
	    <LI>Tail (<CODE>,</CODE>) - arrays of 16 bit values.
	    <LI>Hybrid (<CODE>;</CODE>) - arrays of 32 bit values.
	    <LI>Whirlpool (<CODE>@</CODE>) - special values, see below
	    <LI>Crawling Horror (<CODE>_</CODE>) - these contain compilers.
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	Subscripts, if present, are introduced by the word "SUB" and an expression.
	Multidimensional arrays will require many subscripts, for example
	<CODE>,1 SUB #1 SUB #2</CODE> or <CODE>,1 SUB #1 #2</CODE> (the "SUB" to
	separate subscripts is optional in CLC-INTERCAL and must be omitted in
	C-INTERCAL or INTERCAL-72).

	<P>
	For example, the following are all valid variable names without belonging
	path:
	<PRE><CODE>
	,12 SUB .1 #2 :3
	.1
	.0001</CODE>           (<I>this is the same as </I><CODE>.1</CODE>)<CODE>
	:18 SUB #2
	@21
	;1
	@65535
	</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	The following are not valid for some reason:
	<PRE>
	<CODE>,12</CODE>              <I>requires a subscript (unlsss ,12 is overloaded)</I>
	<CODE>.0</CODE>               <I>variable number cannot be zero</I>
	<CODE>1E-3</CODE>             <I>you might think this is the same as</I> <CODE>.0001</CODE> <I>but isn't</I>
	<CODE>.18 SUB #2</CODE>       <I>this cannot have subscripts (unless .18 is overloaded)</I>
	<CODE>@65536</CODE>           <I>variable number too big</I>
	</PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	When a belonging path is specified, the variable type need not be the
	one specified. For this reason, the following can be valid in some cases
	and invalid in other, depending on whether the result of following the
	belonging chain is an array or not:
	<PRE><CODE>
	$,12 SUB .1 SUB #2 SUB :3
	2.01
	$49.99
	$:1 SUB $49.99
	$$21$$21$$21$$21@21 SUB 1$$21$$21$$21$$21@21 SUB 2$$21$$21$$21$$21@21
	1;1
	1_1
	65535$65535@65535
	</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	Whirlpool registers contain filehandles and information about classes.
	For classes, see <A HREF="lectures.html">the chapter about classes and
	lectures</A>. For filehandles, see <A HREF="input_output.html">the
	chapter about input/output</A>. Register @0 also has special meaning
	during overloading: see <A HREF="#overloading">Operand Overloading</A>
	below.
	</P>

	<P>
	The "crawling horror" registers do not currently enjoy full rights
	and cannot contain any value (the compilers are stored in them, but there
	is no direct access to them). They can, however, be subject to overloading
	and the Belongs TO relation. Please note, however, that at present there
	are only two crawling horrors, <CODE>_1</CODE> and <CODE>_2</CODE>.
	</P>

	<P>
	CLC-INTERCAL 0.05 introduces a new "variable", "*" (splat). For a long time
	it wass not possible to assign a value to it, but it contained the code of
	the last error (hence the name). It is an error to get the value of this
	variable if the program did not encounter an error. Since all runtime errors
	are fatal, it is usually an error to read this variable, and it should be
	avoided. However, a quantum program might have encountered an error and at
	the same time avoided it, therefore it is meaningful to use "splat" in quantum
	programs. Also, if used inside an <A HREF="statements.html#while">event</A>,
	it makes perfect sense to refer to the splat.
	</P>

	<P>
	At some point CLC-INTERCAL declared that every expression can be assigned
	to, at which point it became possible to assign a value to the "*" (splat)
	variable. The effect of doing so is to cause an immediate fatal error, and
	the value being assigned to "*" determines the error message.
	</P>

	<P>
	CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94 contains a number of special registers. These are invisible
	to programs, but accessible to compilers, and control the internal working of
	the system. They are documented in
	<A HREF="parsers.html">the chapter about writing compilers</A>.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="indirect">Indirect Variables</A></H2>

	<P>
	CLC-INTERCAL 0.05 introduced two new operators which might be useful to
	figure out what a register is even after following BELONGS TO, or during
	overloading.
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;worm&quot; ("-") applied to a register returns its number. For example,
	<CODE>-.5</CODE> is the same as #5 (do not confuse the worm with the bookworm,
	which might be printed the same on VDUs). As another example, inside
	overloading (see below), one can obtain the number of the register being
	overloaded with <CODE>-$@0</CODE>.
	</P>

	<P>
	The "intersection-worm" (never heard of this type of worm? we haven't either)
	introduces indirect registers. The syntax is "intersection register worm
	register", and represents a register with the type of the first, the number
	of the second, for example <CODE>+:7-.3</CODE> is the same as <CODE>:3</CODE>.
	Things get interesting when the registers start having belonging paths etc.
	</P>

	<P>
	We were supposed to write some examples here, but frankly, we haven't got
	the energy just now.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="unary">Unary Operators</A></H2>

	<P>
	The unary operators are the standard logical operators, <CODE>AND</CODE>,
	<CODE>OR</CODE> and <CODE>XOR</CODE> (exclusive <CODE>OR</CODE>). They
	should be written as <CODE>&amp;</CODE> for <CODE>AND</CODE> and <CODE>V</CODE>
	for <CODE>OR</CODE>. For <CODE>XOR</CODE>, you should use the bookworm symbol,
	which we cannot represent in this page because it's not in the character
	set. As an approximation, we use the "yen" (<CODE>&#165;</CODE>) symbol, which
	is accepted by the compiler when the input alphabet is ASCII. This only works
	if the source is encoded in either ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8, so the compiler also
	accepts <CODE>V-backspace-worm</CODE>. If the input alphabet is EBCDIC, only the
	bookworm symbol can be used for <CODE>XOR</CODE>. If the compiler is
	in "C-INTERCAL compatibility mode", the what (?) is accepted instead of yen.
	(The "what" has a completely different meaning in CLC-INTERCAL mode, both
	as an unary operator and as a special item to be used inside a
	<CODE>CREATE</CODE> statement).
	</P>

	<P>
	The value of an unary operator is determined by rotating the operand to the
	right one bit, and applying the corresponding bitwise binary operation to
	the result and the original operand.
	</P>

	<P>
	The INTERCAL-72 specification says that the operation is inserted between the
	one spot, two spot or mesh and the number, so <CODE>#&#165;1</CODE> means
	"unary <CODE>XOR</CODE> applied to the number 1" (the result is 32769).
	However, older versions of CLC-INTERCAL also allowed the operator to be used
	as a prefix to an expression,
	as in <CODE>V&#165;&amp;V#&#165;1</CODE> (it will be obvious by now that the
	value is 61440). Current versions no longer allow that. You should not
	have been using it anyway.
	</P>

	<P>
	Note that we have absolutely no idea whether the unary operators "bind"
	more or less than other things. In case of doubt, assign the result of
	subexpressions to some register, or use sparks and rabbit ears to control
	the order of evaluation.
	</P>

	<P>
	C-INTERCAL introduced new unary operators for use with bases between 3 and
	7. These are now available in CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94, but they use a different
	symbol. These are the unary <CODE>BUT</CODE> (a whirlpool (@) in C-INTERCAL,
	or a what (?) in CLC-INTERCAL) and the unary "add without carry" (a shark
	fin (^) in C-INTERCAL, or a spike (|) in CLC-INTERCAL). For bases 4 or greater,
	several types of unary <CODE>BUT</CODE> are available (C-INTERCAL: 2@, 3@, etc;
	CLC-INTERCAL: 2?, 3?, etc). Please consult the documentation which comes
	with C-INTERCAL for more information about these operators.
	</P>

	<P>
	CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-4 introduced a new unary operator, division. This differs
	from normal unary operators because it is arithmetic, not bitwise. The
	operation is as follows: the operand is shifted right arithmetically, then
	the original value is divided by the result of the shift and truncated to
	an integer. Note that the most frequent result is the base, since a right
	shift is equivalent to a division by the base, truncating the result to
	an integer. For example, in base 5, unary division of #62 is #62 divided
	by #12, which just happens to be #5. However, the operation can also
	return other values, for example in base 5 unary division of #12 is #6.
	And of course any value smaller than the base produces a division by zero
	splat.
	</P>

	<P>
	A compiler option, <I>bitwise-divide</I>, changes the unary division
	to behave like a normal unary operation, performing a bitwise rotate
	of its operand and so on. You can figure out what it does, and no doubt
	you've already thought of a use for it. A program containing a "d" in
	the suffix (for example "divide.abcdefi") automatically loads the
	bitwise-divide option.
	</P>

	<P>
	The symbol for the unary division is the worm (<CODE>-</CODE>), so
	for example #-62 is the unary division of #62. Note that the worm
	is also used to construct indirect registers, but that's OK because
	the compiler does not get confused. The programmer might.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="binary">Binary Operators</A></H2>

	<P>
	There are four binary operators: interleave, select, and two forms of
	operand overloading. Operand overloading is implemented in CLC-INTERCAL 0.05
	or newer, and are described in <A HREF="#overloading">the next section</A>.
	</P>

	<P>
	Interleave is written <CODE>&#162;</CODE> (change), but can also be
	represented as <CODE>C-backspace-slat</CODE> or <CODE>C-backslace-spike</CODE>
	if the input alphabet is ASCII. If the compiler is in "C-INTERCAL compatibility
	mode", the big money ($) can be used as well. Note that this means you can't
	use it for belonging paths, but that's OK since C-INTERCAL has no BELONGS TO
	relation.
	</P>

	<P>
	Interleave takes two 16 bit numbers and "interleaves" their bits. For
	example, <CODE>#3&#162;#0</CODE> is 10. To see why, write the numbers
	in binary (3 is 0000000000000011 in binary, so interleaving the bits
	with 0000000000000000 you get 00000000000000000000000000001010, which
	is 10). It can be used to simply form 32 bit constants by writing all
	the "even" bits to the left of the <CODE>&#162;</CODE> and all the
	"odd" bits to the right.
	</P>

	<P>
	Interleave fails if it tries to produce more than 32 bits. Use it only on
	16 bit values!
	</P>

	<P>
	If the base is not 2, interleave works the same way, but interleaves
	digits instead of bits; for example, in base 3, #3&#162;#0 is #9.
	</P>

	<P>
	Select is written <CODE>~</CODE> (sqiggle [sic]). It uses the second number
	to "select" bits in the first number. The bits selected are the ones where
	the second number has a 1. All the bits of the result are right-aligned, and
	padded with 0 to form a 16 bit or a 32 bit number depending on the size of
	the result. Note that if you are planning to apply an unary operator on the
	result of select you don't know in advance whether the 16 bit or 32 bit
	operator will be used, because this is data-dependent. As an example,
	<CODE>:1~#32768</CODE> selects bit 15 of <CODE>:1</CODE> and returns 0 or
	1 accordingly. <CODE>.1~#32770</CODE> selects bits 15 and 2 of <CODE>.1</CODE>
	and can return 0, 1, 2, or 3. C-INTERCAL has a different rule to determine
	the size of the result: it is always the same as the size of the second
	operand. When imitating "ick", CLC-INTERCAL also uses this different rule.
	</P>

	<P>
	If the base is not 2, select works similarly. See the documentation coming
	with C-INTERCAL for a full discussion.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="overloading">Operand Overloading</A></H2>

	<P>
	There are two operand overloading operators: they are written <CODE>/</CODE>
	(slat) and <CODE>\</CODE> (backslat). These are binary operators, but the
	first operand of slat must be a register or a register with subscripts.
	The second operand can be any expression.
	</P>

	<P>
	Both overloading operators return the value of their left operand. In the
	case of slat, any previous overloading which applies to the left operand
	is removed before evaluating it. For example, ".1/#1" returns the value
	contained in .1
	</P>

	<P>
	The <I>side effect</I> of the overloading operators is to change the
	way some registers are used in future. Slat applies to a whole register,
	which can be of any type (spot, two-spot, hybrid, tail, whirlpool or
	if you have added a grammar rule to do that, any special register).
	Whenever that value is used after the overloading, the expression is
	evaluated instead. For example, after ".1/.2" using .1 will return the
	value of .2. The register @0 is temporarily created and made to belong to the
	register being overloaded, so ".1/$@0" is a slightly less efficient way
	to access the value of .1 while on the other hand ".2/@7" would be
	a rather confusing thing in which a spot register acts like a whirlpool,
	so that "DO READ OUT .1 + .2 + .3" would change the filehandle between
	the first and third register instead of outputting a value.
	</P>

	<P>
	Assigning to an overloaded register or array element attempts to invert
	the relevant operations. For example, if .1 is overloaded to .&amp;&amp;2, then
	assigning #4 to .1 will leave .1 unchanged but assign #28 to .2 (this
	is because #&amp;&amp;28 is #4). This does not always work, so you might get a
	runtime error. However, if the expression includes only interleave,
	select, overload, and registers, the assignment always succeeds. The
	unary operators sometimes fail because there are values which they can
	never return (for example, there is no way to get #10 as the result of
	an unary AND, so if .1 is overloaded to .&amp;2, assigning #10 to .1 results
	in an error, while of course assigning #12 would be fine because #&amp;28 is #12).
	</P>

	<P>
	<I>New in CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94</I>. Constants are no longer constants. An
	example will make this clear as mud. Suppose .2 is overloaded to #&amp;&amp;2;
	assigning #4 to .2 will effectively mean assigning #28 to #2 (see the
	discussion in the previous paragraph). Next time your program uses the
	number 2, it will actually use 28 instead. For example, .2 will now have
	the same value as .28, and an expression containing #2 will use #28 instead.
	Moreover, if your program used to have a <CODE>COME FROM (2)</CODE> it
	will now have a <CODE>COME FROM (28)</CODE> in the same place. You can
	use it as a more elegant alternative to computed <CODE>COME FROM</CODE>.
	Also, since grammar symbols are stored as numbers, and since ?SYMBOL
	is stored as 2, any grammar which uses ?SYMBOL (that's every grammar)
	will now use something completely different in its place. However, this
	does not apply retroactively to statements already compiled, however
	desirable this feature might be.  If you are not confused yet, keep reading.
	</P>

	<P>
	The most recent pre-escapes of CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94 go a step further and
	just permit to assign to an expression, so that it is no longer necessary
	to use overloading to modify constants or generate splats. See
	<a href="statements.html#calculate">the chapter about statements</a>
	for mode information.
	</P>

	<P>
	There is an exception to the above rules about constants. Assigning to
	a constant always modifies the original value of the constant. For
	example, this program:
<PRE><CODE>
	DO .2 &lt;- #1
	DO #1 &lt;- #2
	DO READ OUT #1
	DO #1 &lt;- .2
	DO READ OUT #1
	PLEASE GIVE UP
</CODE></CODE>
	will produce "II" and "I", the first READ OUT will find that the current
	value of #1 is actually #2, but the subsequent assignment restores its
	value which had been saved in .2, so it finds that #1 now has value #1.
	This programs produces an identical output because the ".1" finds that
	"1" has value "2" so in fact accesses ".2":
<PRE><CODE>
	DO .2 &lt;- #1
	DO #1 &lt;- #2
	DO READ OUT #1
	DO #1 &lt;- .1
	DO READ OUT #1
	PLEASE GIVE UP
</CODE></CODE>
	Note that it is not possible to do things like STASHing a constant, but
	as shown it's possible to store it in a register and STASH the register,
	so that the constant can be later restored by RETRIEVing the register
	and assigning back to the constant.
	</P>

	<P>
	The backslat operator is similar to slat, except that it affects a range
	of registers. The expression on the left of the backslat is taken as the
	interleaving of two values. The overloading applies to any register with
	a number which is between the two values (if the first value is greater
	than the second, no overloading is done). The register $@0 might be useful
	to retrieve the original register. In the current implementation, this form
	of overloading applies to all "user" registers (spot, two-spot, hybrid and
	tail), but not to classes. For example, "#1&#162;#5"\"$@0~#1" replaces any
	registers between .1 and .5, :1 and :5, ,1 with their lowest-significant bit
	and also replaces registers between ,1 and ,5 and between ;1 and ;5 with
	something which will be invalid at runtime: trying to use an array as
	one would use a number.
	</P>

	<P>
	Overloading loops are eliminated. So if you have .1/.2 and .2/.1, using
	.1 will return .1 (.1 causes evaluation of .2, which causes evaluation of
	.1 - the loop is noted and the overloading of .1 is not applied). This
	means that, in particular, .1/.1 can be used to remove any overloading
	associated with .1 - however, the resulting code will be slower than the
	case when no overloading has been specified, and you should instead localise
	the effects of overloading using statements STASH and RETRIEVE as described
	in <A HREF="statements.html#stash">the chapter about statements</A>.
	</P>

	<P>
	Note that programmer overloading is implemented by all INTERCAL compilers
	known to mankind - it's just that their documentation don't mention this.
	</P>

	<P>
	Also note that you cannot ABSTAIN from overloading, because overloading
	is not a statement. However, you can prevent overloading by IGNORING a
	register.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="grouping">Grouping</A></H2>

	<P>
	The precedence rules for operators are not defined by INTERCAL-72. For
	CLC-INTERCAL, we have absolutely no idea, and different versions use
	different precedences. It might help to either save the results of
	subexpressions in registers or, if all else fails, group subexpression
	using the grouping constructs. A group is started with a spark
	(<CODE>'</CODE>) or rabbit ears (<CODE>"</CODE>) and closed with the
	same symbol it started with. Any expression can go inside a group,
	including any number of sparks or rabbit ears. However, remember that
	the compiler has to make sense of it somehow, so don't be too cruel on
	the poor thing. Just because you can follow sparks nested to 42 levels,
	it doesn't mean that the result will be easy to understand.
	</P>

	<P>
	For example, the expression <CODE>'"#3~#2"&#162;#0'~#2</CODE> has value
	1, whereas the similar expression <CODE>"#3~#2"&#162;#0~#2</CODE> could
	have value 2 - because the compiler may use the whole <CODE>#0~#2</CODE> as
	right operand for the interleave.
	</P>

	<P>
	Note that different compilers might have different ideas about precedence,
	so always include enough sparks and/or rabbit ears to make the expression
	unambiguous if you intend to write portable programs.
	</P>

	<P>
	If a spark is followed immediately by a spot, the two can be "overpunched",
	and they will look like a bang. So, for example, <CODE>'.1~.2'</CODE> could
	be written <CODE>!1~.2</CODE>. A similar effect applies to the rabbit ears,
	but in this case you use a real overpunch (rabbit ears, backspace, spot)
	because there isn't a character looking like the result.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="examples">Examples</A></H2>

	<P>
	Everything should be clear by now, so you won't need any examples.
