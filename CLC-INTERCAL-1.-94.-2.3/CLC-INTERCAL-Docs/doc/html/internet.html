	<H2><A NAME="compiling">Compiling a program with INTERNET support</A></H2>

	<P>
	Starting with CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2, INTERNET is provided as a
	separate package, CLC-INTERCAL-INET. The rest of this chapter
	assumes that you have installed that package.
	</P>

	<P>
	INTERNET is a standard compiler extension, so programs must include the
	appropriate compile option to use it.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	The command-line compiler tool,
	<I>sick</I>, automatically enables the INTERNET extension if the program
	suffix includes the letter &quot;r&quot; (for remote - the letter &quot;i&quot;
	was already used to indicate that the program is an INTERCAL program).
	Alternatively, if you are not relying on <I>sick</I>'s guesses and
	are specifying a list of preloads yourself, just add <I>-pinternet</I>
	to your command line.
	</P>

	<P>
	Using the INTERCAL Calculator, INTERCALC, you can easily add INTERNET
	support by selecting &quot;internet&quot; from the Options menu or by
	adding <I>-ointernet</I> to the command line.
	</P>

	<P>
	The <I>internet</I> compiler object, which implements this extension,
	extends the compiler's syntax to include the STEAL, SMUGGLE and CASE
	statements; it also informs the runtime that the program should be
	listening for theft requests, and start a theft server if required:
	this is described below in the <A HREF="#internals">internals</A>
	section.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="using">Using INTERNET</A></H2>

	<P>
	Once you've enabled INTERNET support, using it is a simple matter of
	using STEAL, SMUGGLE or CASE statements as required; in this context,
	IGNORE and REMEMBER are also useful to allow/disallow access to
	your registers from other programs using STEAL and SMUGGLE. Details
	on these statements can be found in <A HREF="statements.html">the
	chapter about statements</A>.
	</P>

	<P>
	Here is a simple example of an INTERNET program acting as a server:
<PRE><CODE>
	DO IGNORE @1
    (1) PLEASE COME FROM (1)
</CODE></PRE>
	It may seem rather pointless, but in fact this program will wait
	for network connections to SMUGGLE its standard write filehandle
	(normally stored in register @1). The filehandle can not be stolen,
	because it is ignored. The second statement is automatically caught
	by the runtime, which recognises an infinite loop when it sees one,
	and replaced with whatever is internally necessary to wait for a
	network connection: in other words, the busy wait specified by the
	COME FROM statement is replaced by an operating system specific
	wait for network connections, which does not consume any CPU until
	you try to SMUGGLE the standard write.
	</P>

	<P>
	A client could do the following, after initialising the .1 register
	to contain the server's process ID, and the :1 register to contain
	the server's IP address:
<PRE><CODE>
	DO SMUGGLE @1 ON .1 FROM :1
	DO WRITE IN .2
</CODE></PRE>
	what happens here is that one line of input is obtained from the
	<I>server</I>'s standard write, and used in the <I>client</I> to
	assign a value to .2. The server and the client could be in completely
	different networks.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	Note that this example would still work, once,
	if the server did not IGNORE @1 and the client used STEAL instead
	of SMUGGLE, however this would prevent a second client from using
	the same mechanism, because the server would no longer have the
	standard write filehandle available after the first client stole it.
	</P>

	<P>
	We can develop this example a bit further. The server could use the
	system call interface to open a temporary file somewhere on the
	server, and make it available for smuggling to give other INTERCAL
	programs a chance to access the same file - even if they don't have
	access to the computer where the server runs. This program should
	be compiled with both the <I>internet</I> and <I>syscall</I>
	extensions, perhaps by giving it suffix <I>.rsi</I>:
<PRE><CODE>
	PLEASE ,10 &lt;- #18
	DO ,10 SUB  #1 &lt;- #95
	DO ,10 SUB  #2 &lt;- #91
	DO ,10 SUB  #3 &lt;- #93
	PLEASE ,10 SUB  #4 &lt;- #95
	DO ,10 SUB  #5 &lt;- #95
	DO ,10 SUB  #6 &lt;- #80
	DO ,10 SUB  #7 &lt;- #92
	PLEASE ,10 SUB  #8 &lt;- #86
	DO ,10 SUB  #9 &lt;- #91
	DO ,10 SUB #10 &lt;- #93
	DO ,10 SUB #11 &lt;- #95
	PLEASE ,10 SUB #12 &lt;- #95
	DO ,10 SUB #13 &lt;- #69
	DO ,10 SUB #14 &lt;- #65
	DO ,10 SUB #15 &lt;- #74
	PLEASE ,10 SUB #16 &lt;- #94
	DO ,10 SUB #17 &lt;- #65
	DO ,10 SUB #18 &lt;- #74
	DO :10 &lt;- #117
  (666) PLEASE .10 &lt;- #3
	DO IGNORE @10
    (1) DO COME FROM (1)
</CODE></PRE>
	The first part, from the start to the line with label (666),
	opens a file <CODE>/tmp/server</CODE> for reading and writing;
	the file name is stored in ,10 and the required access mode
	in :10, then system call #3 does the rest. The file will be
	associated with class variable @10. All the server has to do
	at this point is IGNORE @10 and wait for it to be smuggled.
	</P>

	<P>
	A client could SMUGGLE @10 and just do normal file operations
	on it (using READ OUT, WRITE IN, and system call #4 and #5
	to perform seeks). Any changes made to the underlying file
	will be visible to other clients, as well as any user on the
	server computer who has access to the underlying file.
	The implementation of the client is left as an exercise to
	the reader.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="#extensions">Compiler extensions added by the INTERNET</A>

	<P>
	The INTERNET extension, when loaded, adds three bytecode opcodes, two
	splats, a register and some run callbacks to the compiler.
	</P>

	<P>
	The following opcodes are added:
	<UL>
	    <LI>CSE - CaSE<BR>
	    Followed by an expression, a count and <I>count</I> pairs of (expression,
	    statement), defines a CASE statement.
	    <LI>SMU - SMUggle<BR>
	    Takes the same arguments as <I>STE</I>, but defines a SMUGGLE statement.
	    <LI>STE - STEal<BR>
	    Followed by a count, <I>count</I> expressions, a second count, the
	    corresponding number of expressions, a third count and the
	    corresponding number of registers, defines a STEAL statement;
	    the first two counts should be #0 or #1, representing the presence
	    or absence of ON and FROM, respectively.
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	The following new splats are defined by these extensions:
	<UL>
	    <LI>*900 Implicit or explicit CASE failed: <I>reason</I><BR>
	    A problem was encountered while looking for other INTERCAL systems
	    <LI>*901 IPv6 Address Translation Problem: <I>error</I><BR>
	    The IPv6 Address Translation Table is full, or something
	    unexpected happened during the translation.
	</UL>

	<P>
	The following special register is added:
	<UL>
	    <LI>%TH - THeft<BR>
	    This register is used internally to determine if INTERNET support
	    is enabled; if this register is #0 the program is not permitted to
	    use STEAL, SMUGGLE or CASE; if the register is #1, the program has
	    full network access to the limit defined by its running environment.
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	The following run callbacks are added:
	<UL>
	<LI>Object creation callback: if there is already a theft server connection,
	stores a reference to it in the object, otherwise sets this to undef
	<LI>Object run callback: if the object does not have a theft server connection,
	starts a theft server if required, then opens a connection to the server and
	stores a reference to it in the object
	</UL>
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="internals">Internals</A></H2>

	<P>
	This section will document the underlying protocol used to
	STEAL and SMUGGLE variables, as well as executing CASE statements;
	it will also show how programs written in other languages can
	communicate with INTERCAL programs using the INTERNET.
	</P>

	<H3>Representation of IP addresses</H3>

	<P>
	IPv4 addresses are represented in the obvious way, as 32 bit numbers.
	The address is always stored in local byte order, so for example 127.0.0.1
	is always #2130706433 (which of course must be written as #28672 &cent; #61441).
	Some IPv4 addresses cannot be represented: addresses where the first octet
	is 224 or higher, corresponding to the multicast range, and addresses where
	the first octet is 127 and at least one of the second or third is nonzero.
	Storing the corresponding numbers in a register may have unexpected results,
	depending on what one was expecting.
	</P>

	<P>
	IPv6 addresses are also represented as 32 bit numbers. Since these addresses
	are 128 bit long, a rather large hammer is required to make them fit in the
	smaller size. The system remembers all the IPv6 addresses it has seen and
	maps them to a fake IPv4 address in one of the two &quot;non-representable&quot;
	ranges:
	</P>

	<P>
	IPv6 unicast addresses are mapped to IPv4 multicast addresses, which have
	the first octet 224 or higher. The localhost address ::1 is always mapped
	to 224.0.0.0 (which must be written as #49152 &cent; #32768); other addresses
	are assigned a mapping as needed, for example when storing the results of
	a DNS lookup or the replies to a multicast query for other computers running
	INTERCAL programs. Note that even multicast queries return unicast addresses,
	as the response to a multicast query is to send back a unicast packet, and
	that will of course have a source IPv6 address identifying the other computer.
	</P>

	<P>
	Link-local addresses are represented in exactly the same way as other unicast
	addresses, but the system remembers which interface they were seen on: this
	means that if two identical link-local addresses are seen on different interfaces,
	they are considered different IPv6 addresses and given different fake IPv4
	addresses: this is necessary because sending to one of these addresses is
	only possible by using the correct interface.
	</P>

	<P>
	IPv6 multicast addresses are mapped to IPv4 addresses in the &quot;localnet&quot;
	range, with the constraint that at least one of the second or third octet is
	nonzero. The fourth octet of such addresses is the interface index, which is
	necessary to determine which interface a multicast packet must use.
	When converting a fake IPv4 address in this range back to an IPv6 multicast
	address, the fourth octet is ignored, so 127.x.y.n results in a look up of
	x.y in an internal table: the result is either a splat if no entry is found,
	or a multicast group address; when sending packets to this group, the fourth
	octet of the original fake IPv4 address provides the interface index.
	This will probably not work for systems with more than 255 interfaces.
	</P>

	<P>
	To store an IPv6 multicast address, the system first checks if it has already
	seen this address, in which case it just stores 127.x.y.n as appropriate; if
	the interface index was not specified, n will be 0. If the address is not found,
	a new x.y value is generated and remembered. The &quot;all nodes on link&quot;
	address ff02::1 is always mapped to 127.0.1.n, so that leaves space in the
	representation for 65534 further IPv6 multicast groups.  Any multicast groups
	specified by configuration will be automatically mapped starting at 127.0.2.n
	when the program loads the INTERNET extension. A DNS lookup of the printable
	representation of a multicast group will return its numeric representation
	and assign them a 32 bit number if required.
	</P>

	<P>
	The documentation package, CLC-INTERCAL-Docs, contains an example program
	&quot;dns.ri&quot; which will WRITE a name IN, perform a DNS lookup, and
	READ OUT the corresponding 32 bit number: running this will show how addresses
	are stored. Note that at present only the first address returned will be
	READ OUT by this program.
	</P>

	<H3><A NAME="callback">Theft callback</A></H3>
	
	<P>
	The INTERNET extension can call a single code reference when a register
	is stolen or smuggled; unlike <A HREF="parsers.html#callbacks">Interpreter
	callbacks</A>, there can be at most one callback for each Interpreter object,
	so if trying to install two of them the second one replaces the first one
	rather than adding to it. The way the callback is executed is also different.
	</P>

	<P>
	To install the callback, a program first needs to request the function
	<I>theft_callback</I> which is not exported by default:
<PRE><CODE>
	use Language::INTERCAL::INET::Extend qw(theft_callback);
</CODE></PRE>
	then install a callback by passing a reference to the Interpreter object
	and a code reference:
<PRE><CODE>
	theft_callback($obj, \&amp;code_to_run);
</CODE></PRE>
	where <CODE>$obj</CODE> is an Interpreter object.
	</P>

	<P>
	The <I>theft_callback</I> function returns the previous callback, if there
	was one, or <I>undef</I> if there wasn't one: the caller could use this
	information to make sure that the previous callback is also called.
	The second argument is actually optional, so calling <I>theft_callback</I>
	with just one argument returns any existing callback without making any
	changes. A callback can be explicitely deleted by passing <I>undef</I> as
	second argument to <I>theft_callback</I>.
	</P>

	<P>
	Once a theft callback is installed in an Interpreter object, the program
	runs as normal, but if one of its registers gets either stolen or
	smuggled the Interpreter will arrange for the theft callback to run
	with 3 arguments: a reference to the Interpreter object, what heppened
	(&quot;STEAL&quot; or &quot;SMUGGLE&quot;), and the name of the register,
	for example if register :2 is stolen this could call:
<PRE><CODE>
	code_to_run(INTERPRETER, 'STEAL', ':2');
</CODE></PRE>
	The <A HREF="intercalc.html"><I>intercalc</I> desk calculator</A> has
	an example of using this callback to inform the user when a register
	is stolen or smuggled (and also an example of how to only do this if
	the INTERNET module is installed).
	</P>

	<H3>Theft server protocol</H3>

	<P>
	A theft server runs alongside any INTERNET-enabled INTERCAL programs and
	provides information about where to find these programs; when a program
	starts it tries to connect to a theft server on localhost, and if
	necessary will start one; if it is unable to start a theft server or to
	connect to a running one, it will refuse to enable INTERNET functions.
	When a theft server is started automatically, it will also monitor
	programs running on localhost and terminate automatically if they
	all stop: this means that the theft server will not be left running
	longer than necessary; it can however be started manually and this
	gives the option to leave it running permanently. See the theft server's
	own documentation.
	</P>

	<P>
	A theft server listens for TCP connections on the INTERNET port specified
	by configuration. Other programs can connect to this for two separate
	functions: to inform the test server that they are running, and to
	find out what is running. The former function is normally only used when
	connecting to localhost, the latter can be used when connecting to a
	theft server anywhere.
	</P>

	<P>
	The theft server obeys common conventions: it sends messages starting
	with a status code, uses carriage-return line-feed sequences to terminate
	lines and all the normal stuff. Even though this is INTERCAL we still
	need to do things somewhat normally when using the network.
	</P>

	<P>
	On accepting connection, the theft server sends a message with status
	code 200 and some information about itself, The message could look like:
<PRE><CODE>
	200 INTERNET on ::1 (CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1)
</CODE></PRE>
	where the <CODE>::1</CODE> will be the address used by the client to reach
	this theft server, and the number at the end is the server's version.
	There is at present no other possible status: either the server is there
	and accepting connections, or it won't be able to send a reply.
	</P>

	<P>
	Once connected to the theft server on localhost, a program is expected
	to declare how it can be reached directly: it will be listening on
	some other port which was otherwise unused and of course it will have
	its own PID. The message to inform the theft server is:
<PRE>
	<CODE>VICTIM </CODE><I>pid</I><CODE> ON PORT </CODE><I>port</I>
</PRE>
	The theft server will validate the information and reply with an appropriate
	status code; error replies will look like one of:
<PRE><CODE>
	530 You have already issued a VICTIM command
	531 That was an invalid PID
	532 I already know about that PID
	533 That was an invalid PORT
	534 I already know about that PORT
</CODE></PRE>
	If on the other hand all goes well the theft server replies with a status
	230 and a message looking like:
<PRE><CODE>
	230 Welcome 1234:4242!
</CODE></PRE>
	From this point until the TCP connection is closed, the theft server will
	assume that the program is running; when the program terminates, it will
	automatically close connection and the theft server will then know it's
	no longer running.
	</P>

	<P>
	Once a client has finished, it could just close connection, but it's
	polite to send:
<PRE><CODE>
	THANKS
</CODE></PRE>
	To which the theft server will reply with status 240 and maybe a message like:
<PRE><CODE>
	240 You are welcome
</CODE></PRE>
	then it will close connection.
	</P>

	<P>
	The above messages are meant for a program running on the same node as the
	theft server, and allow the theft server to maintain a list of who is where.
	The following commands can be used by anybody. local or not, to get this
	information.
	</P>

	<P>
	To find out which process IDs are known to the theft server, issue:
<PRE><CODE>
	CASE PID
</CODE></PRE>
	This always succeeds with status 210. After the status message, the theft
	server sends a list of PIDs and their port, followed by a spot (".") on a
	line by itself; note that the list returned could be empty if the theft
	server has been started manually with instruction not to terminate after
	all local programs exit. The reply line may contain the count of items
	in the line, but it may not: the client is supposed to check for the
	terminating spot rather than rely on the message. An example of reply
	to CASE PID is:
<PRE><CODE>
	210 We have 2 processes running
	4321 ON PORT 2424
	1234 ON PORT 4242
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	Older theft servers just indicated the PIDs without the PORTs, so would
	have said:
<PRE><CODE>
	210 We have 2 processes running
	4321
	1234
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	The client must be prepared to accept either type of list.
	</P>

	<P>
	If a program knows a PID but not its own PORT, it can ask the theft server:
<PRE>
	<CODE>CASE PORT </CODE><I>port</I>
</PRE>
	for example:
<PRE><CODE>
	CASE PORT 1234
</CODE></PRE>
	The server will look for the PID and return a status 220 followed by the
	PORT if it can find it, otherwise status 520. Examples of such messages are:
<PRE><CODE>
	220 4242 is the port you need
	520 No such PID
</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	The theft server also listens for IPv4 broadcasts and IPv6 multicasts on
	the INTERNET port (for IPv6 it will join all multicast groups specified
	in the configuration). This permits to find all theft servers running
	on the local network or, if a global scope multicast group is specified
	by the configuration, all theft servers running anywhere and having the
	same multicast group in their configuration.
	</P>

	<P>
	If the message starts with a number, it is assumed to be somebody
	looking for a node running a program with that PID: the theft server
	will ignore messages which mention a PID it does not know about.
	If it knows the PID, it will reply by sending the message, with a
	space and the corresponding PORT appended, back to sender.
	</P>

	<P>
	If the message does not start with a number, it is assumed to be
	somebody looking for any INTERCAL program. If there is nothing
	running on this node, the theft server will ignore the message;
	if there is something running, it will pick a random one, and
	send back the message, with the PID and the corresponding PORT
	appended, back to sender.
	</P>

	<H3>STEAL and SMUGGLE protocol</H3>

	<P>
	Once an INTERCAL program has found out where to STEAL or SMUGGLE
	from, by connecting to a theft server or in some other way, it
	will open a connection directly to the victim using the victim's
	IP address and the appropriate port, and the protocol described
	in this section.
	</P>

	<P>
	The potential victim accepts connection requests and produces a
	message with status 201 and showing the CLC-INTERCAL version
	number at the end, for example:
<PRE><CODE>
	201 2001:db8::8:42 Example victim (CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1)
</CODE></PRE>
	After that te victim waits for commands and replies until the
	potential thief either disconnects or issues the THANKS command:
<PRE><CODE>
	THANKS
</CODE></PRE>
	To which the VICTIM replies with status 251 and disconnects,
	for example:
<PRE><CODE>
	251 You are welcome
</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	The only two commands accepted are STEAL and SMUGGLE, which
	are both followed by a register name, for example:
<PRE><CODE>
	STEAL .1
	SMUGGLE :2
	STEAL @3
</CODE></PRE>
	If the operation is permitted, the victim replies with a status
	250 followed by the current value of the register, described below;
	if the operation fails it replies with a 55x status depending on
	the reason:
	<UL>
	<LI>551 - The register does not start with a spot, two spot, tail,
	hybrid or whirlpool
	<LI>552 - The register does not exist, maybe it has already been stolen
	<LI>553 - The operation was STEAL and the register is IGNOREd
	<LI>554 - The operation was SMUGGLE and the register is not IGNOREd
	<LI>555 - Other reasons prevent the operation from completing
	</UL>
	Example messages include:
<PRE><CODE>
	551 I've never seen a register called $42
	552 Register @5 is not a valid class or filehandle
	553 I'm ignoring :2 so it cannot be stolen
	554 I remember @1 so it cannot be smuggled
	555 A timeout occurred, maybe a 555 chip is faulty
</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	When the reply is a status 250 it is followed by a list of values
	terminated by a line containing a spot (".") all by itself.
	The contents of the list depend on the type of register being
	stolen or smuggled.
	</P>

	<P>
	For a spot or two-spot register the list contains just one element,
	the value of the register. If this fits in 16 bits, it is sent as
	it is, otherwise as an interleave of two values.  This interleave
	is always binary, independently of the current base of either the
	thief or the victim. For example, a reply to STEAL :1 where :1
	contains #32768 could be:
<PRE><CODE>
	250 Here is :1
	#32768
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	However a reply to SMUGGLE :2 where :2 contains 805306371 would say:
<PRE><CODE>
	250 Here is :2
	#16385 &cent; #16385
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	Note that the choice of simple number or an interleave depends on
	the actual value returned, not on the type of the register which
	contains that value.
	</P>

	<P>
	For a tail or hybrid register the list will contain a number of
	calculations which would reconstruct the register, starting with
	dimensioning it and then assigning to all its subscripts. For
	example if ,1 is a 2 by 2 matrix an answer to STEAL ,1 could be:
<PRE><CODE>
	250 Here is ,1
	,1 &lt;- #2 BY #2
	,1 SUB #1 SUB #1 &lt;- #8
	,1 SUB #1 SUB #2 &lt;- #1
	,1 SUB #2 SUB #2 &lt;- #42
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	Note that one element (SUB #2 SUB #1) has not been sent because it
	was zero, and it is not necessary to assign that explicitely.
	For a hybrid register the result is similar, but a value may need
	to be expressed as an interleave (always in base 2), for example
	after SMUGGLE :2 the victim could say:
<PRE><CODE>
	250 Here is ;2
	;2 &lt;- #4
	;2 SUB #1 &lt;- #8191 &cent; #8191
	;2 SUB #3 &lt;- #42
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	Whirlpool registers can contain classes, filehandles or both. The
	answer therefore can contain one or both of the following elements:
	an exported filehandle and a list of subjects.
	</P>

	<P>
	An exported filehandle is just a single line in the reply and
	looks like an array dimensioning, except that it specifies
	the TCP port, the filehandle's read character set, the write
	character set and the access mode, respectively, For example
	stealing the standard input (with STEAL @1) could reply:
<PRE><CODE>
	250 Here is @1
	@1 &lt;- #37851 BY ?ASCII BY ?ASCII BY ?w
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	This means that the victim is listening on TCP port 37851 for operations
	on the filehandle (see next subsection), both character sets are ASCII
	and the mode is "w", for "write", meaning of course that it can only
	do input (WRITE IN).
	</P>

	<P>
	When the filehandle has also been used as a class, it will have one
	or more subjects: these are listed one per line as a calculation
	in which the filehandle is treated as an array, the subscript is the
	subject and the value is the label where the lecture happens, for
	example if the victim had executed:
<PRE><CODE>
	DO STUDY #1 AT (1200) IN CLASS @4
	PLEASE STUDY #8 AT (1500) IN CLASS @4
	DO IGNORE @4
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	The reply to a "SMUGGLE @4" could be:
<PRE><CODE>
	250 Here is @4
	@4 SUB #1 &lt;- #1200
	@4 SUB #8 &lt;- #1500
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	As an aside, using "@4 SUB #1" in any calculation will return #1200
	because a class can be used as an array to see its subjects, and
	"@4 SUB #2" would splat with "*254 Invalid subject: #2"; assigning
	to these expression is equivalent to executing a STUDY statement,
	so the above reply could be executed exactly by the thief to
	reconstruct the class. Note that the lectures will be executed in
	the context of the thief, not the victim: unlike filehandles,
	classes are not exported.
	</P>

	<P>
	Of course a whirlpool register can have both, so after the victim
	has executed:
<PRE><CODE>
	DO STUDY #1 AT (1000) IN CLASS @3
</CODE></PRE>
	A thief can STEAL @3 and this will get both the subject taught in
	the class and the victim's standard splat. The victim's reply
	could be:
<PRE><CODE>
	250 Here is @3
	@3 &lt;- #36851 BY ?ASCII BY ?ASCII BY ?r
	@3 SUB #1 &lt;- #1000
	.
</CODE></PRE>
	And if the thief now splats, the error message will be displayed
	in the victim's standard splat. So the thief does:
<PRE><CODE>
	DO STEAL @3 ON ....
	PLEASE READ OUT @3 SUB #1
	DO READ OUT @3 SUB #2
</CODE></PRE>
	This will produce "M" on the thief's standard read filehandle
	and "*254 Invalid subject: #2" on the victim's standard splat.
	</P>

	<H3>Stolen filehandle protocol</H3>

	<P>
	After an INTERCAL program STEALs or SMUGGLEs a filehandle from
	another program, it can use this filehandle like any normal
	filehandle, and the effects will happen in the victim's environment.
	The victim will indicate a TCP port for the stolen or smuggle
	filehandle, and the thief will connect to it using the protocol
	described in this section.
	</P>

	<P>
	The victim will select a TCP port the filehandle and inform the
	thief of it during the execution of the STEAL or SMUGGLE statement
	which resulted in the filehandle being transferred. Since an
	IGNOREd filehandle can be SMUGGLEd by several programs, the
	victim will provide the same TCP port to all the thiefs, and will
	coordinate access to the real filehandle on their behalf.
	</P>

	<P>
	On accepting connection the victim will reply with a 202 status;
	the message will include the version number, for example:
<PRE><CODE>
	202 2001:db8::42 Example filenandle (CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1)
</CODE></PRE>
	The thief can then issue various file operations and conclude with
	either disconnecting or sending the <CODE>THANKS</CODE> command,
	to which the filehandle will reply with a 284 status, for example:
<PRE><CODE>
	284 You are welcome
</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	If the filehandle corresponds to a seekable file, there are two
	commands to get and set the file position:
<PRE>
	<CODE>SEEK </CODE><I>position</I> <I>whence</I>
	<CODE>TELL</CODE>
</PRE>
	The first sets the file position to <I>position</I> calculated with
	respect to <I>whence</I>: the former is an integer value with an
	optional sign and the latter is one of "SET", "CUR" or "END",
	indicating that the position is relative to the start of the file,
	the current position or the end of file, respectively: these are
	the same parameters one would pass to the <I>lseek</I> system call
	when the filehandle corresponds to a real file. The reply to
	<CODE>SEEK</CODE> could look like:
<PRE><CODE>
	281 </CODE><I>newpos</I><CODE> is the new file position
	581 Not seekable
	582 Invalid file position
	583 Cannot use SEEK_END on this filehandle
</CODE></PRE>
	In the first case, <I>newpos</I> will be the <I>position</I> added to
	the file offset specified by <I>whence</I>. If the command returns a
	failure status the file position does not change.
	</P>

	<P>
	Note that if the filehandle has been smuggled by more than one thief,
	each of them will maintain a separate idea of the file position.
	</P>

	<P>
	To send data to the filehandle (for example to execute a READ OUT
	statement), issue the READ command:
<PRE>
	<CODE>READ </CODE><I>length</I>
</PRE>
	where <I>length</I> is the number of bytes the thief wants to send.
	The filehandle will consider if it can cope with that much data and
	reply with either a 383 status to indicate it's waiting for the data,
	or a 583 status to indicate that something went wrong; the messages
	could look like:
<PRE><CODE>
	383 OK, send the data
	583 Not enough buffer space
</CODE></PRE>
	If the filehandle is willing to accept the data, send it immediately
	and it will try to read it out, giving either a 283 status if all went
	well, or a 58x status to indicate an error, for example:
<PRE><CODE>
	283 OK, we punched 42 cards with that data
	585 Data size mismatch
	586 I/O error: alien invasion interrupted the operation
</CODE></PRE>
	The 585 reply can only happen if the thief closes the sending half of
	the network socket before sending the required data, or in consequence
	of a network error. Other errors will result in a 586 reply. After a
	283 status, the file position will be advanced by <I>length</I>; after
	a 58x status, the file position remains unchanged.
	</P>

	<P>
	To get data from the filehandle, there are two operations, depending
	on whether the thief wants a fixed block of data or a line, defined
	as everything from the current file position to the first newline
	character.
	</P>

	<P>
	To get a fixed block of data, for example to handle a binary WRITE IN
	statement, issue thw WRITE command:
<PRE>
	<CODE>WRITE </CODE><I>length</I>
</PRE>
	where <I>length</I> is the number of bytes the thief wants to get.
	The filehandle will try to write that much data in and return either
	a 282 status indicating how much data it could actually write, followed
	immediately by the data itself, or a 584 to indicate an error. Note that
	the number of bytes returned could be less than requested, for example
	if an end of file was encountered before all the data was written in.
	The result messages could look like:
<PRE><CODE>
	282 420 bytes follow; you asked for 512 but we couldn't find that many
	584 The card reader is offline
</CODE></PRE>
	Note that the 282 status line terminates with a carriage-return, line-feed
	sequence like all network messages: the data follows immediately after
	the line-feed, and is not terminated by anything special.
	</P>

	<P>
	To get a line of text, issue the WRITE TEXT command:
<PRE>
	<CODE>WRITE TEXT /</CODE><I>newline</I><CODE>/</CODE>
</PRE>
	where <I>newline</I> is either an empty string to indicate the default
	newline for the system where the filehandle really is (which could be
	anywhere if it has been stolen from somebody who stole it from somebody
	else), or a string indicating the thief's idea of a newline, in which a
	sequence of s bang ("!") followed by three digits gets replaced with the
	character whose code in decimal is given by the three digits. For example,
	to write a line terminated by carriage-return, line-feed sequence:
<PRE><CODE>
	WRITE TEXT /!013|010/
</CODE></PRE>
	and to write a line terminated by the string "Fubar":
<PRE><CODE>
	WRITE TEXT /Fubar/
</CODE></PRE>
	The result is similar to the WRITE command, either a 282 status indicating
	how much data was written, followed immediately by the data, or a 584
	status to indicate an error. For example:
<PRE><CODE>
	282 80 bytes
	584 I/O error
</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	If it's necessary or even just useful to know whether the stolen
	filehandle corresponds to a terminal somewhere, issue the ISTERM
	command:
<PRE><CODE>
	ISTERM
</CODE></PRE>
	This has two different status returns depending on the answer: 285
	means that the filehandle is a terminal, and 286 that it isn't. If
	the information is not available, it returns 587. Example messages:
<PRE><CODE>
	285 This filehandle is connected to a VT-220 in a computer museum
	286 It appears that this is a (non INTERCAL) network socket
	587 This is the Babbage Difference Engine and has no concept of terminal
</CODE></PRE>
	The filehandle itself might have been stolen and then stolen from the
	thief, then stolen again, so any operation on it will be a sequence of
	network connections; ultimately, however, it will be a real filehandle;
	if this is running on a system with a library function resembling
	<I>isatty</I>, and calling that function returns a valid result, this
	determines whether you get a 285 or a 286; anything else, you get a 587.
