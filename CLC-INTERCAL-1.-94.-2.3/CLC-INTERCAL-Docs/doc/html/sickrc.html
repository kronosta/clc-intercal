	</P>

	<P>
	This document describes the CLC-INTERCAL configuration system for
	escape 1.-94.-2.1 or newer. The file format used before was different
	and was never documented: it is now considered obsolete. The format
	described here has an extension mechanism which may be sufficient to
	avoid any incompatible changes in the future, and if we think of
	something so different it doesn't fit, perhaps we'll have a second
	file format to use alongside this one. Meanwhile, the format described
	here is considered stable.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="files">List of configuration files used by the system</A></H2>

	<P>
	Starting with CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1, CLC-INTERCAL's configuration has
	been split into several files, with each extension optionally installing
	a file containing its defaults, and both the system administrator and
	each user able to add their own changes to these defaults.
	</P>

	<P>
	The package-installed files are found in the package installation
	&quot;Include&quot; directory, which is the same directory as any
	pre-compiled objects. The file name for all these files is
	<I>NAME</I>,sickrc, where <I>NAME</I> is either &quot;system&quot;
	for the main configuration file, or the name of an extension,
	for example &quot;INET&quot; for the INTERNET extension.
	The &quot;system&quot; file is always read first, followed by any
	installed extension configuration.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	After reading the package-installed configuration, the system reads
	all files in the directory &quot;/etc/sick&quot;, processing them in
	lexycographic order (using the &quot;C&quot; locale). These files
	can add to package-installed configuration, or they can replace it
	with completely new items. Processing of these files can be blocked
	by specifying the <B>--nosystemrc</B> option to <I>sick</I>,
	<I>intercalc</I> or when running any generated object.
	</P>

	<P>
	Finally, if a file &quot;.sickrc&quot; exists in the user's home
	directory, that will be processed and can augment or replace settings
	in the previously processed files.  Processing of the user's
	&quot;.sickrc&quot; file can be blocked by specifying the
	<B>--nouserrc</B> option to <I>sick</I>, <I>intercalc</I> or when
	running any generated object.
	</P>

	<P>
	An easy way to list all configuration files the system can find, and
	to mark the ones it would actually read, is to type:
<PRE>
	sick [--nouserrc] [--nosystemrc] [-I<i>directory</i>]... --rclist
</PRE>
	This will show the files found, one per line, with a "splat" next to
	the ones it would actually read, taking into account the other
	options supplied. Note that if two files with the same name are
	present in different directories, this will list both, but only
	one of them will be marked by a splat.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="syntax">Configuration file syntax</A></H2>

	<P>
	Each configuration file has a simple and regular syntax, which can
	contain comments, setting of scalar option values, deleting all values
	from an array option or appending values to an array option: the last
	two can be used to replace array contents.
	</P>

	<P>
	Comments start like in INTERCAL with &quot;PLEASE NOT&quot; or &quot;DO NOT&quot;
	followed by any text, and they extend until a valid configuration item starts.
	</P>

	<P>
	Any configuration item, even comments, can be preceded by a conditional
	with the generic syntax:
<PRE>
	WHEN I IMITATE <I>who</I>
</PRE>
	where <I>who</I> is one of "sick", "ick" or "1972": the item will be
	ignored when the compiler is imitating somebody else.
	</P>

	<P>
	Setting of a scalar value has the generic syntax:
<PRE>
	I CAN <I>VERB</I> <I>OBJECT</I>
</PRE>
	where <I>VERB</I> determines which value is being set, and <I>OBJECT</I>
	determines how it is being set. The <I>VERB</I> must correspond to a
	valid scalar option, which is defined by the INTERCAL system or by a
	installed extension. For example, if the INTERNET extension is installed,
	it uses the <I>VERB</I> &quot;BLURT&quot; to determine which TCP and UDP
	port it will use, so the <I>OBJECT</I> supplied to &quot;BLURT&quot; must
	be a valid port number, so:
<PRE>
	I CAN BLURT 64928
</PRE>
	means to use port 64928 for all INTERNET-related communications.
	</P>

	<P>
	Appending a value to an array has exactly the same generic syntax as setting
	a scalar value:
<PRE>
	I CAN <I>VERB</I> <I>OBJECT</I>
</PRE>
	the difference being that <I>VERB</I> must be defined as an array option
	rather than a scalar. For arrays, a related statement removes all existing
	elements:
<PRE>
	I DON'T <I>VERB</I>
</PRE>
	For example, looking again at the INTERNET extension, the list of IPv6
	multicast groups is specified using the verb &quot;READ&quot; because
	the server will READ OUT discovery packets to these groups, and so to
	replace the array with just &quot;all nodes&quot; on the locally connected
	networks, plus a global scope group, one could say:
<PRE>
	I DON'T READ
	I CAN READ ff02::1
	I CAN READ ff1e::42
</PRE>
	Omitting the first line would append two groups to any existing list.
	</P>

	<P>
	Some arrays require each element to have an explicit priority expressed
	as a number after the &quot;CAN&quot;: for example the base system contains
	support for four character sets: to guess the one used by a source program,
	they are tried in order of increasing priority. The default definition is:
<PRE>
	I DON'T WRITE
	WHEN I IMITATE sick
	I CAN #20 WRITE Baudot
	I CAN #30 WRITE EBCDIC
	I CAN #10 WRITE ASCII
	I CAN #40 WRITE Hollerith
</PRE>
	which means that ASCII is preferred (lowest value actually means highest
	priority), followed by Baudot, EBCDIC and finally Hollerith. Obviously
	the verb &quot;WRITE&quot; is used for this as the compiler will be
	WRITING IN programs. Additionally, the Baudot set will be skipped
	when imitating "ick" or "1972".
	</P>

	<P>
	For arrays, it is also possible to remove a single element by using
	"I CAN'T"; this is most useful in user's configuration, to remove support
	for something installed in the system. It is not an error to remove
	something which wasn't there in the first place. For example, a
	user who knows for a fact they'll never use punched cards or Baudot
	terminals could remove support by having the lines:
<PRE>
	I CAN'T WRITE Hollerith
	I CAN'T WRITE Baudot
</PRE>
	In their ".sickrc" file. Note that this does not specify a priority:
	if "Hollerith" was in the list, it'll be removed, and the priority is
	not important. In this example, this would be equivalent to having:
<PRE>
	I DON'T WRITE
	I CAN #30 WRITE EBCDIC
	I CAN #10 WRITE ASCII
</PRE>
	However if the system had more character sets the first version would
	leave all the extra ones in, the second would remove them all and
	keep just ASCII and EBCDIC.
	</P>

	<P>
	The next few sections detail which <I>VERB</I>s are defined by the base
	system and all extensions currently provided, together with the exact
	syntax of their <I>OBJECT</I>s.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="system">system.sickrc: base system configuration</A></H2>

	<P>
	The base system defines a number of <I>VERB</I>s:
	<UL>
	<LI>WRITE<BR>
	Array with priorities: Character set selection: the <I>OBJECT</I>s are
	names of character sets as known to the Language::INTERCAL::Charset
	module. The &quot;system.sickrc&quot; file lists all character sets
	which have been included in CLC-INTERCAL since 0.01; new character
	sets will be offered in future in the form of optional packages, and
	these will include their own <I>module</I>.sickrc to add to this list so
	that the new character sets can be recognised when the system is guessing.
	<LI>SPEAK<BR>
	Array with priorities: User interface selection: the <I>OBJECT</I>s are
	names of interface modules as known to the Language::INTERCAL::Interface
	module. &quot;None&quot; is part of the base system and always available,
	and also automatically included by the &quot;system.sickrc&quot; file
	provided: it corresponds to the batch mode of <I>sick</I> and
	<I>intercalc</I>. Other interfaces are provided by optional packages,
	each of which will also add its own sickrc file to register what it
	provides.
	<LI>UNDERSTAND<BR>
	Array (without priorities): controls the compiler and option selection
	based on suffix. See below.
	<LI>SCAN<BR>
	Array (without priorities) of directories where the compiler will search
	for C-INTERCAL-style system libraries; each element can contain normal
	shell glob characters.
	<LI>GLUE<BR>
	Array (without priorities) explaining to the compiler when to include
	a C-INTERCAL-style system library; the elements are described later in
	this section.
	</UL>
	</P>

	<H3>UNDERSTAND</H3>

	<P>
	The &quot;UNDERSTAND&quot; <I>VERB</I> controls selection of compilers
	and options based on the suffix. The general theory is that the <I>OBJECT</I>s
	contain patterns and actions: the suffix is matched against each pattern
	in turn, and if the match succeeds, the system performs the corresponding
	actions. There are three types of actions: adding a compiler or option
	to the list being constructed, making sure a compiler or option will not
	be added by later processing, and restarting the matching.
	</P>

	<P>
	The generic syntax for an <I>OBJECT</I> of &quot;UNDERSTAND&quot; is:
<PRE>
	I CAN UNDERSTAND <I>PATTERN</I> [+ <I>PATTERN</I>]...
		AS <I>STRING</I>
		WITH <I>OPTION</I> [+ <I>OPTION</I>]...
		RETRYING <I>STRING</I>
		IGNORING <I>OPTION</I> [+ <I>OPTION</I>]...
</PRE>
	where the items listed in the first two lines are always present,
	each of the other three lines can be completely omitted. And of course
	we split things in lines for clarity but a single long line or
	splitting at random places will all do perfectly well.
	</P>

	<P>
	Patterns are simple strings which may contain one or more whirlpool
	(@) symbols: these act as wildcards, matching anything except the first
	character of the whole string. Since the string usually starts with a
	spot (.), this means that the whirlpool matches anything except a
	spot, and this means that a name containing more than one spot will
	only try matching against the last section, the spotless suffix.
	For example, the following will match any suffix ending with
	&quot;ci&quot; or &quot;ti&quot;
<PRE>
	I CAN UNDERSTAND .@ci + .@ti AS "CI or TI suffix"
</PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;AS&quot; and a string must always be provided. The compiler
	doesn't do anything with them, but can print them out in verbose
	mode, so it helps if the string describes what is going on.
	</P>

	<P>
	The simplest action is &quot;RETRYING&quot;: this takes a string,
	which can contain a single whirlpool, and causes the suffix matching
	to restart, using the string as new suffix; if the string contains
	a whirlpool, this will be replaced with everything matched by a
	whirlpool in the pattern. Note that restarting does not clear the
	list of options being constructed. For example, the following
	would simply ignore a letter &quot;z&quot; anywhere in the suffix:
<PRE>
	I CAN UNDERSTAND .@z@i AS "NO z" RETRYING .@i
</PRE>
	the pattern matches any suffix containing a &quot;z&quot; and
	ending with a &quot;i&quot;, then restart the processing with the
	same suffix but omitting the &quot;z&quot;: if presented with
	.abzcdei it will start the processing again with .abcdei
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;WITH&quot; action, followed by a list of strings adds
	each of these strings to the current list of options, unless they
	have already been added or they are being ignored. For example:
<PRE>
	I CAN UNDERSTAND .@7@i AS "BASE 7" WITH 7 RETRYING .@i
</PRE>
	matches a suffix containing a 7, adds the option &quot;7&quot;
	(which will load 7.io which in turn sets the base to 7) and
	then restart processing after removing the 7 from the suffix.
	</P>

	<P>
	The last action is &quot;IGNORING&quot; which does not make any
	changes to the list already constructed, but asks that some options
	will not be added in later processing. For example, the following
	forces the compiler to be <I>sick</I> and makes sure that <i>ick</I>
	is not added later:
<PRE>
	I CAN UNDERSTAND .@clc@i AS "CLC-INTERCAL"
	WITH sick IGNORING ick RETRYING .@i
</PRE>
	Presented with a suffix .clcti it will set the compiler to &quot;sick&quot;
	then restart processing with suffix .ti - this would normally set the
	compiler to <I>ick</I> for compatibility with the &quot;thick&quot;
	compiler, however the &quot;IGNORING&quot; makes sure that this does
	not happen, so when the new suffix matches the rule:
<PRE>
	I CAN UNDERSTAND .@t@i AS "Threaded INTERCAL"
	WITH ick + thick IGNORING sick RETRYING .@i
</PRE>
	it will add the <I>thick</I> option but won't add <I>ick</I> because
	it's been IGNOREd. The &quot;IGNORING sick&quot; in this case does not
	do anything as <I>sick</I> is already present in the list constructed
	before; however it is there to make sure that only one compiler can
	be selected by a combination of suffixes.
	</P>

	<H3>GLUE</H3>

	<P>
	The &quot;GLUE&quot; <I>VERB</I> controls selection of system libraries
	in the style of C-INTERCAL: this is INTERCAL source code which is compiled
	together with the program specified by the user, and which are included
	automatically when certain conditions are met. Note that the mechanism
	could in theory be used with any other compiler.
	</P>

	<P>
	The generic syntax for an <I>OBJECT</I> of &quot;GLUE&quot; is:
<PRE>
	I CAN GLUE <I>FILENAME</I> [AND IF OPTIMISED <I>FILENAME</I>]
	    TO THE END OF THE PROGRAM
		WHEN <I>CONDITION</I>
		[AND <I>CONDITION</I>]...
</PRE>
	One or more <I>CONDITION</I>s specify when this mechanism will be
	used, and the first (or only) <I>FILENAME</I> is the name of the
	library to glue to the program. If the optional "AND IF OPTIMISED"
	and the second <I>FILENAME</I> is provided, the latter will be used
	when looking for optimised objects; if not specified, and if the
	user has asked for optimisation, the compiler will try to guess a
	suitable optimised object by replacing the suffix with ".o.io",
	see below for some examples.
	</P>

	<P>
	The <I>CONDITION</I>s look like:
<PRE>
	COMPILER IS <I>name</I>
	BASE IS <I>number</I>
	BASE IS @
	BASE IS NOT <I>number</I>
	PROGRAM USES UNDEFINED LABEL <I>numbner</I>
	PROGRAM USES UNDEFINED LABELS BETWEEN <I>numbner</I> AND <I>number</I>
</PRE>
	If more than a condition is specified, they must all be true or the
	rule will be ignored; the value "@" for the base means "any base",
	and any "@" in the <I>FILENAME</I> will be replaced by the actual
	base.
	</P>

	<P>
	For example:
<PRE>
	I CAN GLUE syslib.i TO THE END OF THE PROGRAM
	      WHEN COMPILER IS ick
	       AND BASE IS 2
	       AND PROGRAM USES UNDEFINED LABELS BETWEEN 1000 AND 1999
</PRE>
	specifies that a program compiled with "ick" in base 2 which makes
	a reference to a label between 1000 and 1999 but does not define
	them will include "syslib.i". Since no optimised object has been
	specified, when the user asks for optimisation the compiler will
	try to locate a "syslib.o.io" pre-build object, and if found use
	it, if not found it will include "syslib.i" as in the case when
	no optimisation is required.
	</P>

	<P>
	For a base other than 2, the library provided by C-INTERCAL contains
	the base twice, like syslib3.3i, syslib4.4i etc. To find it, we
	could say:
<PRE>
	I CAN GLUE syslib@.@i TO THE END OF THE PROGRAM
	      WHEN COMPILER IS ick
	       AND BASE IS @
	       AND BASE IS NOT 2
	       AND PROGRAM USES UNDEFINED LABELS BETWEEN 1000 AND 1999
</PRE>
	However the optimised syslib.o.io has been built to work in any base,
	when necessary it looks up the current base; the compiler would not
	find it, as it would be looking for syslib3.o.io etc. So we say:
<PRE>
	I CAN GLUE syslib@.@i AND IF OPTIMISED syslib.o.io
	  TO THE END OF THE PROGRAM
	      WHEN COMPILER IS ick
	       AND BASE IS @
	       AND BASE IS NOT 2
	       AND PROGRAM USES UNDEFINED LABELS BETWEEN 1000 AND 1999
</PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	The default system.sickrc provided includes the rules to find
	syslib*.*i and syslib.o.io as described, and in addition has:
<PRE>
	I CAN GLUE floatlib.i TO THE END OF THE PROGRAM
	      WHEN COMPILER IS ick
	       AND BASE IS 2
	       AND PROGRAM USES UNDEFINED LABELS BETWEEN 5000 AND 5999
</PRE>
	Together, all this configuration corresponds to the C-INTERCAL
	algorithm to decide when to include various library files, with
	two major differences: it is written in an easy-to-understand
	configuration syntax rather than being obfuscated inside a C
	program; and the programmer is responsible for obtaining these
	files, which are at present not provided by CLC-INTERCAL.
	To assist, the default system.sickrc also says:
<PRE>
	I CAN SCAN /usr/share/ick*
	I CAN SCAN /usr/local/share/ick*
</PRE>
	These are the most likely places these libraries would be installed,
	however the configuration can be modified in the usual way if the
	administrator has installed things somewhere else.
	</P>

	<P>
	Note that it is not necessary to obtain the C-INTERCAL's system
	and floating-point libraries if the programmer accepts the use of
	the optimiser: in this case, the program will link to a Perl module
	provided by CLC-INTERCAL rather than build C-INTERCAL's libraries
	from source.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="inet">INET.sickrc: INTERNET configuration</A></H2>

	<P>
	The INTERNET extension, when installed, defines three new <I>VERB</I>s,
	&quot;BLURT&quot; to specify the TCP and UDP port, &quot;READ&quot; to
	specify a list of IPv6 multicast groups to use when looking for other
	programs, and &quot;THROW&quot; for the default multicast hop limits.
	The included &quot;INET.sickrc&quot; contains:
<PRE>
	I CAN BLURT 64928
	I DON'T READ
	I CAN READ ff02::1 THROWING 1
	I DON'T THROW
	I CAN THROW 0 TO 1
	I CAN THROW 1 TO 2
	I CAN THROW 10
</PRE>
	And the rest of this section attempts to explain what that measn.
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;BLURT&quot; <I>VERB</I> specifies the UDP and TCP port
	numbers used for all network communications: this includes TCP
	connections to a theft server, UDP broadcasts and multicasts for
	node discovery, and UDP replies to node discovery requests.
	The <I>OBJECT</I> is a simple number between 1 and 65535, without
	the initial &quot;#&quot;.
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;READ&quot; <I>VERB</I> specifies an array of multicast
	groups used for node discovery: the program READs out to these groups
	whenever it runs a CASE, STEAL or SMUGGLE statement which requires
	to obtain a list of hosts. Additionally, the theft-server will join
	all these groups and waits for packets on them.
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;READ&quot; array does not have priorities: the program reads
	out to all the groups listed, then waits for replies. The syntax of a
	single element is an IPv6 multicast group address in normal
	presentation format, optionally followed by the gerund
	&quot;THROWING&quot; and a hop limit: this indicates how far the
	program will try to throw the query: 0 means that it only stays on
	the local host and will reach the local theft server; 1 means that
	the packet will go out on locally-attached networks, but will not cross
	gateways, even if they have working multicast routing set up; and a
	number <I>n</I> greater than 1 means that they will attempt to cross
	gateways but they stop when they encounter the <I>n</I>-th one, or in
	other words they will cross at most <I>n-1</I> gateways.
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;THROW&quot; array specifies default hop limits for any
	multicast groups which do not provide one: this includes any elements
	of the &quot;READ&quot; array without a &quot;THROWING&quot; gerund,
	as well as any multicast addresses specified by the program using the
	CASE, STEAL or SMUGGLE statement, since there is at present no way
	to indicate a hop limit in an INTERCAL program. The syntax of each
	element of the &quot;THROW&quot; array is the hop limit as a number
	followed optionally by &quot;TO&quot; and a scope identifier: when
	sending a packet to scope <I>S</I> the program will find the first
	array element with &quot;TO <I>S</I>&quot; and uses the corresponding
	hop limit: if no such element exists, it will locate the first one
	which does not include the &quot;TO&quot;, and if none is found it
	will use the system default.
	</P>

	<P>
	Therefore the included &quot;INET.sickrc&quot; means: use UDP and TCP
	port 64928; when searching for servers, use the &quot;all nodes&quot;
	multicast group ff02::1, setting the hop limit to 1 (locally-attached
	networks only); and when sending to a multicast group which does not
	specify a hop limit, use limit 0 (local host only) for packets with
	node-local scope, hop limit 1 (local networks only) for packets with
	link-local scope, and hop limit 10 for any other scopes.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="icalc">ICALC.sickrc: calculator configuration</A></H2>

	<P>
	The calculator, <I>intercalc</I> adds two scalar <I>VERB</I>s to specify
	the default operation mode and the default compiler and options to use.
	The &quot;ICALC.sickrc&quot; provides system defaults:
<PRE>
	I CAN OPERATE full
	I CAN CALCULATE sick + 2
</PRE>
	In general, the operation mode (&quot;OPERATE&quot;) can be one of
	&quot;full&quot;, &quot;expr&quot; or &quot;oic&quot; and the
	default compiler can be any installed compiler followed by any options
	one would want to pass: the default specifies CLC-INTERCAL and base 2,
	with no other options. Note that &quot;CALCULATE&quot; takes a list
	of object names separated by intersections, and is not an array.
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;Save settings&quot; menu item (or backspark-c in the line
	mode interface) reads the current configuration out to the user's
	&quot;.sickrc&quot; file; this will contain any values previously found
	there, modified with the options selected while running the calculator.
	Options which were not changed in the &quot;.sickrc&quot; file will not
	be included, but can of course be added with a normal text editor if
	so desired.
	</P>

	<P>
	Because the desk calculator is currently the only thing which uses any
	interfaces, the ICALC extension also adds a number of <I>VERB</I>s related
	to displaying things. It is possible that this may move to the Base
	package in the far future when <I>sick</I> also starts using interfaces.
	Note that not all this configuration applies to all possible interfaces:
	they will ignore what does not apply to them.
	</P>

	<P>
	All the <I>VERB</I>s controlling output specify arrays: for each of
	these <I>VERB</I>s, and for each type of item, the first applicable
	entry will be used, and if there is no applicable entry the default
	value will be used. Note that there are no explicit priorities, so
	the order these things appear in the configuration is significant.
	</P>

	<P>
	The "DRAW" <I>VERB</I> selects a font and size to use for drawing selected
	elements; obviously this is ignored by interfaces like Curses which rely
	on a terminal to display characters and have no control on what font this
	will use. The general format of the <I>OBJECT</I> is:
<PRE>
	<CODE>I CAN DRAW</CODE> <I>list-of-items</I> <CODE>IN</CODE> <I>font-name</I>
</PRE>
	optionally followed by a size:
<PRE>
	<CODE>AT</CODE> <I>font-size</I>
</PRE>
	optionally followed by a list of interfaces this configuration applies:
<PRE>
	<CODE>WHEN USING</CODE> <I>list-of-interfaces</I>
</PRE>
	The <I>list-of-items</I> and <I>list-of-interfaces</I> are explained
	below; the <I>font-name</I> is any font name recognised by the system
	and <I>font-size</I> is a number.
	</P>

	<P>
	A <I>list-of-items</I> is one or more of the following items, separated
	by intersections:
	<UL>
	<LI>ENABLED KEYS<BR>
	Use this configuration when displaying a key on the calculator keypad,
	if it is currently meaningful to press that key.
	<LI>DISABLED KEYS<BR>
	Use this configuration when displaying a key on the calculator keypad,
	if the key has currently no meaningful action; for example, after
	typing a partial statement, any keys which cannot produce something
	valid will be disabled, so often after pressing "P", "L", "E", "A"
	and "S" all keys except "E" will be shown as disabled.
	<LI>ENABLED MENUS<BR>
	This configuration applies to any menu items which are currently enabled,
	that is they can be selected and will have some meaningful action.
	<LI>DISABLED MENUS<BR>
	This configuration applies to any menu items which are currently disabled,
	that is they cannot be selected and would not have a meaningful action
	if they could be selected.
	<LI>CURRENT ITEM<BR>
	This is used to highlight the current menu entry, or for interfaces where
	this makes sense, the current key; for example, after opening a menu, its
	first enabled entry will use this configuration to display, and moving the
	cursor to a different entry will revert it to ENABLED MENUS, and display
	the next enabled one as CURRENT ITEM.
	<LI>MESSAGES<BR>
	Use this configuration for any other output not covered by any of the
	previous items
	<LI>FRAMES<BR>
	We mention this here because it's a valid item type, but selecting a font
	for it has no meaning: this is meant to be used with the "PAINT" <I>VERB</I>
	described below.
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	A <I>list-of-interfaces</I> is just a list of user interface modules which
	this configuration will apply to. If omitted, it defaults to "all the
	interfaces" which at the time of writing means "WHEN USING Curses + X".
	Note that the interface names have to be written exactly or they won't
	be recognised.
	</P>

	<P>
	The "FRAME" <I>VERB</I> applies to interfaces which produce characters, as
	opposed to pixels, currently this means the Curses interface. The <I>OBJECT</I>
	is the word "WITH" followed by either "ASCII" or "LINE DRAWING", and then
	the optional list of interfaces it applies to. For example:
<PRE><CODE>
	I CAN FRAME WITH LINE DRAWING
</CODE></PRE>
	this controls whether Unicode line drawing characters will be used, which
	requires that they are supported by the terminal; if the terminal does not
	support them, they will be displayed as blanks, but the following will
	revert to the old behaviour (before 1.-94.-2.1) which used normal ASCII
	characters to approximate things:
<PRE><CODE>
	I CAN FRAME WITH ASCII
</CODE></PRE>
	The list of interfaces could be useful for example if a future interface
	provides a functionality similar to Curses but more powerful, let's
	say we'll be calling that new interface Excursion:
<PRE><CODE>
	I CAN FRAME WITH ASCII WHEN USING Curses
	I CAN FRAME WITH LINE DRAWIN WHEN USING Excursion
</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	The "POINT" <I>VERB</I> applies to interfaces in which the use of mouse
	is optional: this currently means the Curses interface only. The
	<I>OBJECT</I> is either "WITH THE MOUSE" or "WITHOUT THE MOUSE", and
	determines whether the interface will grab the mouse and translate
	mouse click events to button presses, or will leave it to its default
	function in the environment it runs on. If the mouse is not supported,
	this option will have no effect.
	</P>

	<P>
	The "PAINT" <I>VERB</I> specifies a colour, and optionally a background,
	for some items. The general form is:
<PRE>
	<CODE>I CAN PAINT</CODE> <I>list-of-items</I> <CODE>IN</CODE> <I>colour-name</I>
</PRE>
	optionally followed by a background colour:
<PRE>
	<CODE>ON</CODE> <I>colour-name</I>
</PRE>
	optionally followed by a list of interfaces this configuration applies:
<PRE>
	<CODE>WHEN USING</CODE> <I>list-of-interfaces</I>
</PRE>
	The <I>list-of-items</I> and <I>list-of-interfaces</I> are as above;
	the <I>colour-name</I> is currently one of "black", "white", "red",
	"green", "blue", "yellow", "magenta" or "cyan". Future versions will
	support more colours, depending on the interface's capabilities.
	</P>

	<P>
	The remaining <I>VERB</I>s all have the same format:
<PRE>
	<CODE>I CAN</CODE> <I>verb</I> <I>list-of-items</I>
</PRE>
	optionally followed by a list of interfaces this configuration applies:
<PRE>
	<CODE>WHEN USING</CODE> <I>list-of-interfaces</I>
</PRE>
	The <I>list-of-items</I> and <I>list-of-interfaces</I> are as above;
	the <I>verb</I> is one of:
	<UL>
	<LI>EMBOLDEN<BR>
	The items listed will be made to look more bold than the default
	<LI>ITALICISE<BR>
	The items listed will be italicised
	<LI>UNDERLINE<BR>
	The items listed will be underlined
	<LI>REVERSE<BR>
	THe items listed will be shown with colours reversed; this is not the
	same as using "PAINT" and swapping the background and foreground
	colours, because other system settings may have specified an alternative
	meaning for this.
	<LI>DIM<BR>
	The items listed will be made less visible than the default
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	It is often necessary to specify several <I>VERB</I>s for each type of
	item, for example to make the current item display in 36 point Courier
	bold italic and green on a red background (we make no promise that the
	result is legible), and enabled keys the same but red on a black
	background:
<PRE><CODE>
	I CAN PAINT CURRENT ITEM IN GREEN ON RED
	I CAN PAINT ENABLED KEYS IN RED ON BLACK
	I CAN DRAW CURRENT ITEM + ENABLED KEYS IN Courier AT 36
	I CAN EMBOLDEN CURRENT ITEM + ENABLED KEYS
	I CAN ITALICISE CURRENT ITEM + ENABLED KEYS
</CODE></PRE>
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="ui">UI-<i>Name</I>.sickrc: interface configuration</A></H2>

	<P>
	The base system defines the verb &quot;SPEAK&quot; to determine which user
	interface will be preferred by the calculator (and, when it gets a proper
	development environment, by the compiler itself). The array requires to
	specify priorities, and the <I>OBJECT</I>s are just names of an interface
	module. The base system just defined a single interface, &quot;None&quot;
	which corresponds to the batch mode of <I>intercalc</I> and <I>sick</I>,
	and has priority 65535:
<PRE>
	I DON'T SPEAK
	I CAN #65535 SPEAK None
</PRE>
	Each user interface installed will add to this list indicating what
	interfaces it supports and a priority; the files
	&quot;UI-<I>Name</I>.sickrc&quot; all contain a single line adding
	one interface; the combined effect of installing all three interface
	modules will be:
<PRE>
	I CAN #100 SPEAK X
	I CAN #200 SPEAK Curses
	I CAN #300 SPEAK Line
</PRE>
	So X is the preferred one, if installed and running in a graphical
	environment, after that Curses, if installed and the terminal
	supports it, the Line if installed and the terminal supports it,
	and finally None if nothing else works.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="example">Local configuration example</A></H2>

	<P>
	A system administrator may decide to install all available interface
	modules, but because of a sadistic streak makes &quot;None&quot;
	the preferred one. They install a file &quot;/etc/sick/ui&quot;
	containing:
<PRE>
	I DON'T SPEAK
	I CAN #1 SPEAK None
	I CAN #5 SPEAK X
	I CAN #4 SPEAK Curses
	I CAN #2 SPEAK Line
</PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	A user who has read this documentation undoes the change by
	putting the following five lines in their &quot;.sickrc&quot; file:
<PRE>
	I DON'T SPEAK
	I CAN #9 SPEAK None
	I CAN #8 SPEAK X
	I CAN #7 SPEAK Curses
	I CAN #6 SPEAK Line
</PRE>
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="extend">How an extension adds its own configuration</A></H2>

	<P>
	An extension defines a module &quot;Language::INTERCAL::<I>NAME</I>::Extend&quot;
	containing a subrouting &quot;add_rcdef&quot; to extend the syntax of the
	configuration files. Note that most extensions will have such a module because
	it can also add opcodes, registers and splats and most extensions will need
	to do at least some of that.
	</P>

	<P>
	The &quot;add_rcdef&quot; is called with three arguments: a code reference,
	the name of the extension (usually <I>Name</I>) and the name of the module
	processing this without the initial &quot;Language::INTERCAL::&quot; (this
	will usually be Rcfile). The subroutine is expected to call the code
	reference once for each <I>VERB</I> it wants to add, passing it six
	arguments:
	<UL>
	<LI>VERB<BR>
	The <I>VERB</I> to add. It must not clash with an existing one.
	<LI>CHECK<BR>
	A code reference which checks the <I>OBJECT</I>'s syntax and returns a
	value to store: it receives three arguments, a reference to the configuration
	object, the verb itself, and the value.
	<LI>PRINT<BR>
	An optional code reference which takes a stored <I>OBJECT</I> and converts
	it to a string. If this is <I>undef</I> the value is printed as it is found.
	<LI>ARRAY?<BR>
	A true value specifies that the <I>VERB</I> takes an array, a false value
	that it takes a scalar.
	<LI>PRIORITY?<BR>
	A true value requires that objects have an associated priority; a false
	value requires that they don't have one; for scalar values, this must be false.
	<LI>DESCRIPTION<BR>
	Any string the extension wants to add as a comment when the configuration
	is saved to file.
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	For example, the INET extension adds a scalar <I>VERB</I> to specify the
	TCP and UDP port, &quot;BLURT&quot; with a code like:
<PRE>
	$code-&gt;('BLURT', \&amp;_c_blurt, undef, 0, 0, 'Default INTERNET port');
</PRE>
	the &quot;_c_blurt&quot; function just checks if it has been passed a number
	between 1 and 65535, and throws an exception if not; it returns the number
	itself, therefore there is no special PRINT code. The comment is used when
	saving the configuration which will look something like:
<PRE>
	PLEASE NOTE: Default INTERNET port
	I CAN BLURT 4242
</PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	For an example of arrays without priorities, the INET extension also defines
	another <I>VERB</I>, &quot;READ&quot; with code like:
<PRE>
	$code-&gt;('READ', \&amp;_c_read, \&amp;_p_read, 1, 0, 'INTERNET multicast groups');
</PRE>
	In this case, &quot;_c_read&quot; parses an IPv6 address, checks that it
	is a valid multicast group, and returns the 128-bit binary representation.
	Therefore it needs a function to convert it back to a string, which is
	provided by &quot;_p_read&quot;. A saved configuration may look like:
<PRE>
	PLEASE NOTE: INTERNET multicast groups
	I DON'T READ
	I CAN READ ff02::1
	I CAN READ ff1e::42
</PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	None of the extensions define a <I>VERB</I> which takes a prioritised array,
	but the mechanism is similar, just set the 5th argument to 1 instead of 0.
	The CHECK and PRINT functions do not deal with priorities but just with the
	<I>OBJECT</I>: the compiler will take care of parsing priorities and using
	them to sort the list. An example can be seen in the base system's source
	for Language::INTERCAL::Rcfile.
	</P>
