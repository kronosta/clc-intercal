	<H2><A NAME="intercalc">The INTERCAL calculator</A></H2>
	<P>
	Starting from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-4, a new INTERCAL calculator is
	included with the distribution. Apart from the obvious use as a luxury
	desk calculator, the calculator is useful to quickly test fragments of
	INTERCAL programs by just typing them in the calculator and seeing what
	happens. Note that some statements are by necessity not supported,
	for example COME FROMs have no real meaning as each statement is
	executed as a separate program. ABSTAIN FROM and friends, however,
	are supported: you can even say things line "DO ABSTAIN FROM (1)",
	them write out the state to a file, exit the calculator, start it
	up again, write the state back in, type "(1) DO .1 &lt;- #2" and the
	statement will not be executed: the calculator remembers it's supposed
	to be ABSTAINed FROM.
	</P>

	<P>
	<I>intercalc</I> requires CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-4 and newer. It won't work with
	older versions.
	</P>

	<P>
	Starting with CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2, <I>intercalc</I> is provided as a
	separate package, CLC-INTERCAL-ICALC. The various User Interfaces are
	also probided as separate packages, so you can install just the ones
	you use.
	</P>

	<P>
	By default, if started without instructions to the contrary, <I>intercalc</I>
	uses the configuration to decide what kind of user interface to use; the
	default depends on which CLC-INTERCAL extensions are installed, but it will
	try things in the following order until one works.
	<UL>
	<LI>X<BR>
	Available if the UI-X extension is installed. It works when the calculator
	runns on a system supporting either Gtk3 or Gtk2, and requires the corresponding
	perl module installed (Gtk3 or Gtk2). If both perl modules are installed,
	Gtk3 is preferred.
	<LI>Curses<BR>
	Available if the UI-Curses extension and the Curses perl module are both
	installed; it requires a terminal with sufficient capabilities, like an
	xterm, a Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD console, a serial terminal like
	a VT-220, in fact almost anything except a line printer.
	<LI>Line<BR>
	Available if the UI-Line extension and the Term::ReadLine::Gnu perl module
	are both installed; other Term::ReadLine perl modules are currently not
	supported but will probably be in future; it requires a terminal with sufficient
	capabilities, like anything mentioned in the previous item and maybe a few
	more. It may even work on a line printer, although this is untested.
	<LI>Batch<BR>
	Always available as long as your program has something connected to standard
	input, for example a keyboard, a card reader, or redirection from a file.
	This mode is also referred to as &quot;None&quot; because it's implemented
	by a tiny &quot;interface&quot; called UI-None which is included in the
	Base package.
	</UL>
	The default can be changed as described in <a href="sickrc.html">the sickrc
	specification</a>.
	</P>

	<P>
	In the remainder of this chapter, we speak of &quot;interactive&quot;
	interface to mean &quot;anything except batch mode&quot; and of
	&quot;windowed&quot; interface to mean X or Curses, as opposed to
	Line or Batch.
	</P>

	<P>
	The arguments on the command line are either options (in the form
	<I>--name</I><CODE>=</CODE><I>value</I> or <I>-xvalue</I>), or filenames.
	If a filename is encountered, it must be a file previously created by
	<I>intercalc</I> using the Read As or Read Out option. Specifiying a file is
	equivalent to selecting Write In first thing after the calculator starts up.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="command">Command-line options</A></H2>
	<P>
	There is a number of command-line options, which are grouped
	by type for easy reference.
	</P>

	<H3>User interface options</H3>

	<P>
	If the automatic user interface selection does not give the required
	result, the following options can be used to control what happens:
	</P>

	<TABLE>
	    <TR><TH ALIGN="left">Long option</TH><TH ALIGN="left">Short</TH><TH ALIGN="left">Meaning</TH></TR>
	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--graphic</TD><TD ALIGN="left">-X</TD><TD ALIGN="left">GTK-based graphical interface</TD></TR>
	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--curses</TD><TD ALIGN="left">-c</TD><TD ALIGN="left">Curses-based text interface</TD></TR>

	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--batch</TD><TD ALIGN="left"></TD><TD ALIGN="left">Batch mode, no user interface</TD></TR>
	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--interface=<I>NAME</I></TD><TD ALIGN="left">-i<I>NAME</I></TD><TD ALIGN="left">Load the specified interface</TD></TR>
	</TABLE>

	<P>
	The --interface option can be used to load third-party interface modules which
	<i>intercalc</I> would not otherwise know about: it will look for them in the
	standard perl include path. Note however that any interface modules using the
	recommended extension mechanism will add itself to the list of interfaces
	<i>intercalc</i> tries if not told otherwise, so it may just work without
	having to say anything on the command line.
	</P>

	<H3>Compiler options and operating mode</H3>

	<P>
	These are either the name of the compiler to use, and any extensions
	which you wish to load initially, or other options which control how
	the compiler behaves.
	</P>

	<TABLE>
	    <TR><TH ALIGN="left">Long option</TH><TH ALIGN="left">Short</TH><TH ALIGN="left">Meaning</TH></TR>
	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--include=<I>DIR</I></TD ALIGN="left"><TD>-I<I>D ALIGN="left"IR</I></TD><TD>Add directory to search path for compiler objects</TD></TR>

	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--ubug=<I>NUMBER</I></TD><TD ALIGN="left"></TD><TD ALIGN="left">Change the probability of the unexplainable compiler bug</TD></TR>
	</TABLE>

	<P>
	The calculator currently defines three operating modes: <I>full</I> (the default), <I>expr</I> and <I>oic</I>.
	</P>

	<P>
	In <I>full</I> mode, the full power of the selected compiler and extensions is available. One types
	INTERCAL statements and watches them execute. Additionally, for convenience, one can type an
	expression and this will be evaluated and its result displayed. It is internally implemented by
	pretending you typed &quot;DO READ OUT <I>expression</I>&quot;.
	</P>

	<P>
	<I>expr</I> mode is a restricted form of full mode, where you can only execute assignments and evaluate
	expressions; other statements are disallowed. Assignments are specified without the initial DO and/or PLEASE.
	Expressions can of course contain overloading and other side-effects, which will be remembered and will
	come back to cause unexpected results later. This mode is suitable for a desk calculator.
	</P>

	<P>
	<I>oic</I> mode is a silly &quot;One Instruction&quot; desk calculator which is there because we can.
	This mode is currently undocumented.
	</P>

	<H3>Misc options</H3>

	<P>
	The following options control the way <I>intercalc</I> operates:
	</P>

	<TABLE>
	    <TR><TH ALIGN="left">Long option</TH><TH ALIGN="left">Short</TH><TH ALIGN="left">Meaning</TH></TR>
	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--nouserrc</TD><TD ALIGN="left"></TD><TD ALIGN="left">Ignore <I>.sickrc</I> files</I> found</TD></TR>
	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--nosystemrrc</TD><TD ALIGN="left"></TD><TD ALIGN="left">Ignore any files in <I>/etc/sick</I></TD></TR>

	    <TR><TD ALIGN="left">--interpreter=<I>NAME</I></TD><TD ALIGN="left"></TD><TD ALIGN="left">Uses an alternative CLC-INTERCAL Interpreter</TD></TR>
	</TABLE>

	<H2><A NAME="using">Using the calculator</A></H2>

	<P>
	Once the calculator has started, it will display its window (in windowed
	mode), print its prompt (in Line mode), or simply wait for input (in
	batch mode). In any case, you enter statements or expressions and
	watch them execute.
	</P>

	<P>
	Some menus are available in windowed mode to change the current compiler,
	base and operating mode. These should be self-explanatory in the X
	interface; for the Curses interface, see below. For non-windowed interfaces,
	there is an alternative mechanism to access the functionality provided
	by menus in windowed mode, see below.
	</P>

	<P>
	In X mode you can provide input by clicking on a key or by pressing the
	corresponding key on the keyboard if there is one (some symbols may not
	be available on all keyboards). The menus work in the obvious way. There
	is at present no keyboard shortcut for the menus, but it may be added
	in future.
	</P>

	<P>
	In Curses mode you can press the key if it exists on the keyboard, or use
	the cursor keys (up, down, left, right) to highlight one of the buttons on
	the screen, then press Enter to activate it. Note that Enter does not
	terminate the line in Curses mode: to do that, press F5 (Do It) or
	&quot;=&quot; key, or navigate to the F5 button and press Enter. This may
	work different from other systems. To open a menu with a label starting
	with <I>X</I>, press Alt-<I>X</I>, for example Alt-L will open the
	Language menu. If the keyboard cannot produce this, the Escape and backspark
	(&quot;`&quot;) keys will highlight the first menu, then the left and
	right cursor keys can move between menus, and Enter or down will open the
	menu. Another Escape or backspark will return to the main keypad. If you
	wanted a normal user interface, presumably you wouldn't be using an
	INTERCAL calculator.
	</P>

	<P>
	If the system's curses library and the terminal both support it, the
	Curses module can also use the mouse. Add the statement:
<PRE><CODE>
	I CAN POINT WITH THE MOUSE
</CODE></PRE>
	To a configuration file to enable it. Clicking the first mouse button
	while the cursor is on any enabled key or menu will do the corresponding
	action and make that key or menu the current item.
	</P>

	<P>
	In line and batch mode, access to menu functions can be achieved by starting
	a line with a backspark (<CODE>`</CODE>) and a letter. In Line mode you can
	see what letters make sense by pressing Tab twice after the backspark, which
	will give you a list. In any case, the following backsparks are available:
	</P>

	</TABLE>

	<P>
	If you do not provide an argument to `b, `l, `m or `o, they will show
	a list. Currently selected base, language, mode or options (respectively)
	will be marked with a splat. The Line interface will also show all
	possible completions if you press Tab twice, so "`l Tab Tab" shows all
	available languages and so on.
