	CLC-INTERCAL introduces an unique infrastructure over the registers. We
	shall explain it with an example.
	</P>

	<P>
	Imagine building a tree structure in other languages. You have a root, and
	there are pointers from the root to other nodes, which in turn have pointers
	to other nodes, until you get to the leaves.
	</P>

	<P>
	This all sounds simple, but it has several drawbacks. The most important,
	is that each node can have an arbitrary number of children, so you need to
	start using messy techniques like variable-length lists. Also, if the
	nodes need to contain values as well as pointers, you need to remember
	reserving the extra space.
	</P>

	<P>
	CLC-INTERCAL does not suffer from these problems. By simply reversing the
	pointers, you can easily see that any leaf or node has exactly one parent.
	We call this a BELONGS TO relation. Because the relation is an infrastructure
	built on top of the registers, you can still use them for something else:
	a popular choice of "something else" is to store values in them.
	</P>

	<P>
	As an example, consider the following binary tree in LISP notation:
	((1, (2, 3)), (4, ((5, 6), 7))). It looks awfully complicated for a seven
	leaves data structure. To write that in CLC-INTERCAL one could do:
<PRE>
        PLEASE DO .1 &lt;- #1
        DO MAKE .1 BELONG TO .3
        DO .2 &lt;- #2
        DO MAKE .2 BELONG TO .4
        PLEASE .5 &lt;- #3
        DO MAKE .5 BELONG TO .4
        DO MAKE .4 BELONG TO .3
        DO MAKE .3 BELONG TO .6
        PLEASE .7 &lt;- #4
        DO MAKE .7 BELONG TO .8
        DO .9 &lt;- #5
        DO MAKE .9 BELONG TO .10
        PLEASE .11 &lt;- #6
        DO MAKE .11 BELONG TO .10
        DO MAKE .10 BELONG TO .12
        DO .13 &lt;- #7
        PLEASE MAKE .13 BELONG TO .12
        DO MAKE .12 BELONG TO .8
        DO MAKE .8 BELONG TO .6
</PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	The root of the tree is <CODE>.6</CODE>. Its two subtrees are <CODE>.3</CODE>
	and <CODE>.8</CODE>. Down the left subtree, we note that both <CODE>.1</CODE>
	and <CODE>.4</CODE> BELONG TO it. And so on, just as simple as the rest of
	INTERCAL.
	</P>

	<P>
	Since we have removed the need to use variable-length lists to represent
	trees, we can reintroduce them to represent more complicated data structures.
	This means that a register can be made to belong to more than one other register.
	</P>

	<P>
	If you know that a register belongs to another one you can get the name of
	the latter by prefixing the former with a big-money symbol (<CODE>$</CODE>).
	If a register happens to BELONG TO more than one register, the big-money
	symbol is the one it was most recently made to belong to. The previous one
	is accessed with the prefix 2 (two), and the one before it with the prefix 3
	(three). Therefore up to nine different registers can be accessed that way,
	if it belongs to that many. For example, after:
<PRE>
	PLEASE .1 &lt;- #2
	DO .2 &lt;- #5
	DO .3 &lt;- #8
	DO MAKE .3 BELONG TO .2
	DO MAKE .3 BELONG TO .1
	DO MAKE .3 BELONG TO .3
</PRE>
	The register <CODE>$.3</CODE> would be itself, while <CODE>2.3</CODE> would
	be <CODE>.1</CODE> and <CODE>3.3</CODE> would be <CODE>.2</CODE>.
	</P>

	<P>
	The prefix can be repeated as necesary: if a register .1 belongs to .2 which
	in turn belongs to .3, then $$.1 is .3 etcetera. There is no limit. If prefixes
	are repeated, they are executed from left to right.
	Thus, in the above example, <CODE>$$2.3</CODE> would be the same as
	<CODE>2.3</CODE> aka <CODE>.1</CODE> (because <CODE>$.3</CODE> is the same
	as <CODE>.3</CODE>). On the other hand, <CODE>2$$.3</CODE> is an error,
	because <CODE>2.3</CODE> is <CODE>.1</CODE>, which does not belong to
	anything. Note that this order of evaluation of prefixes differs from the
	way other languages do that.
	</P>

	<P>
	If you were wondering why CLC-INTERCAL has registers which cannot hold any
	value (whirlpool, <CODE>@</CODE>), here's is why. They can be made to belong
	and in turn oteher registers can be made to belong to them. So you can use
	them as indirect references to other registers. In fact, this is what the
	lecture system does. See <A HREF="lectures.html">the chapter on Classes
	and Lectures</A>.
	</P>

	<P>
	This documentation occasionally refers to a register as a "group" if
	another register BELONGs TO it.
	</P>

	<P>
	One more note. When a register is STASHed, any information about which groups
	it belongs to is saved in the STASH. When it is retrieved, the belonging
	information comes back from the STASH. Also, if you MAKE a register BELONG
	while it's ignored, nothing happens, and similarly when you MAKE it NO LONGER BELONG.
	</P>

	<P>
	If you think to use this mechanism as pointers, you'll find out that you
	very quickly run into problems. We won't tell you how, as it would spoil
	the fun.
	</P>
