Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.2 to 1.-94.-2.3

* Moved the Docs-specific build from the Base package, and added
  new ones to convert the example programs to HTML.

* Documentation and example programs for the new "trickle down"
  structure and the corresponding statements.

* Updated to show the new options to the "sick" command-line tool
  to control program source listing.

* Changed the install documentation now that Net::Interface is
  no longer necessary in many situations.

* The build process uses the new program listing option in "sick" to
  produce annotated HTML versions of the example programs. These are
  not installed, but they could be copied to a server manually.

* Clarified what happens when one modifies constants, as much as this
  subject can be clarified.

* Updated Makefile.PL for the build system changes

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1 to 1.-94.-2.2

* Also added example programs and documentation for new features
  being added to Base

* Added two more example programs for the "system call" extension,
  as I needed them to test the functions with the new Interpreter.

* Clarified what happens when ABSTAIN FROM or REINSTATE specify a
  list of gerunds, and CONVERT or SWAP could have changed what
  that means. Also COME FROM gerund and NEXT FROM gerund.

* The Interpreter rewrite also meant that the new extension mechanism
  has seen some changes, so the documentation here has been updated
  to reflect that; also added a note that this mechanism is not yet
  fully defined and is subject to change, with the mechanism expected
  to be stable by 1.-94.-1

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2 to 1.-94.-2.1

* Documented the sickrc file format and its extension mechanism.

* Updated to document the new extension mechanism and other changes
  in other parts of the distribution.

* Moved the INTERNET-specific bytecode, spats and register to
  internet.html, where it logically belongs.

* Some examples updated, some new examples.

* Some clarifications and updates on the INTERNET extension.

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-3 to 1.-94.-2

* Created new package containing just the documentation, so
  that it doesn't need to be distributed with every version
  of CLC-INTERCAL.
