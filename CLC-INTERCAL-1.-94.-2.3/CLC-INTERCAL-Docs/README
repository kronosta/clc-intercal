CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.3 -- Documentation

This package provides documentation for CLC-INTERCAL.

You do not normally install this package, rather you can build it then
copy the resulting documentation to some web server (or a local directory
where you can point your browser).

An online version will be made available in the near future.

To build the documentation, make sure you install at least:

* CLC-INTERCAL-Base >= 1.-94.-2.3
* CLC-INTERCAL-INET >= 1.-94.-2.3

(or else install this as part of the Bundle): these two packages are
required to build the generated documentation and examples.

Run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make

This will copy the files into

    blib/htmldoc

You can then copy the documentation somewhere useful.
There is no (useful) "install" script at this time.

A number of very simple example programs have been collected in

    doc/examples

These don't do anything useful, but demonstrate a particular statement or
concept. After installing the Base package, most of these can run as they
are with a command like:

    sick -lRun doc/examples/(name).i

Some of these programs require the INET package to be installed, and they
have suffix ".ri".

The build process will try to generate syntax highlighting for all example
programs, and put the result in

    blib/htmlexamples

There is an online copy of the latest version, including any information
about work in progress which has not appeared in an escape yet, at:

The example programs (in the syntax highlighted version) can also be seen at:
