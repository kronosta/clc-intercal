Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.2 to 1.-94.-2.3

* Added an optional XS-based module to find the list of network
  interfaces, which will be built if Makefile.PL determines that
  it is likely to work; otherwise, it falls back on looking for
  Net::Interface, after checking that the installed version
  provides the necessary information (it still requires a patch
  on NetBSD, so the aim is to get our module to work there instead,
  and of course to use our module in other systems if possible).

* Changed the register steal/smuggle protocol to use the same save/load
  functions as the calculator; if both ends support it, the new protocol
  will be used, otherwise they fall back to the old one. The new protocol
  can provide more information about the registers, such as enrols,
  belonging and the new trickle down structure.

* Improved some error messages to help figure out what might have gone
  wrong with the network.

* Updated Makefile.PL for the build system changes

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1 to 1.-94.-2.2

* Updated the extension module to reflect changes in the extension
  mechanism.

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2 to 1.-94.-2.1

* Added code to support IPv6 multicast groups other than the "all nodes"
  group.

* Updated the extension code to also register new configuration it needs,
  like port number and multicast groups. Updated the code which needs to
  access configuration to use the new mechanism.

* Changed t/00use.t to use Language::INTERCAL::Distribute

* IPv6 support added to the INTERNET library. Also see changes in the
  "Docs" package explaining how 128-bit addresses end up stored in
  32-bit registers. For here, it suffices to say that no other language
  does it the same way, for very good reasons.

* Removed Language::INTERCAL::HostIP and added a dependency on
  Net::Interface instead. Considered IO::Interface but it seems that
  Net::Interface suits our needs better. This also allows us to remove
  the dependency on Net::Netmask which was used but not checked.

* Moved all INTERNET-specific stuff from Base package except Server which
  is still needed by Base.

* Change the code starting a theft-server to locate the one associated
  with the running program, and if not finding one in $PATH. This means
  that it's now possible to run the compiler from an uninstalled build,
  with the appropriate "-I" to perl, and the theft-server will run from
  the build directory even if another one is installed in $PATH: this
  obviously helps with testing new versions.

* Various other networking improvements.

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-3 to 1.-94.-2

* Created new package containing just the INTERNET stuff, so
  that it doesn't need to be distributed with every version
  of CLC-INTERCAL. Also, people who don't like the idea of
  their INTERCAL programs reaching out to the world don't
  need to install this.
