CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.3 -- Graphical interface

This package installs a graphical user interface to CLC-INTERCAL.
At present, only the INTERCAL calculator, "intercalc", uses this interface,
although a future release of "sick" will be able to use it as well.

CLC-INTERCAL Base 1.-94.-2.3 or newer must be installed before this
package.

To install, run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Note that this interface has a runtime dependency on either the Gtk3
or the Gtk2 perl module, if neither is found it will not run (if both
are found, it will prefer Gtk3).

Makefile.PL will print a warning if it cannot find a suitable Gtk module
to use.
