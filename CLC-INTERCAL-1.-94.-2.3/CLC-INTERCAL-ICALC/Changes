Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.2 to 1.-94.-2.3

* Updated the calculator's save/load state functions to match changes
  in the Base package.

* Implemented test t/06intercalc-state.t which has been present but empty
  for a long time.

* Updated Makefile.PL for the build system changes

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2.1 to 1.-94.-2.2

* Updated the calculator to use the Interpreter::State module rather
  than Interpreter as some functionality has moved; also added a
  command-line option to select a different interpreter, which will
  be useful to test future Interpreter changes.

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2 to 1.-94.-2.1

* Added an extension module so that the calculator can register
  the configuration it needs, and a default configuration file in
  ICALC.sickrc. Updated code which needs configuration to use the
  new mechanism.

* Changed t/00use.t to use Language::INTERCAL::Distribute

* Changed intercalc to check if the INET extension is installed and only
  run the INET-specific code if it is.

Changes from CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-3 to 1.-94.-2

* Made a separate calculator package, so that the compiler can
  be installed without the calculator (but of course not vice
  versa).
