This is version 1.-94.-2.3.

You will need to unzip the .tar.gz file into Linux to actually use it (the `_aux` directory is supposed to be named `aux` but Windows doesn't allow that so I can't do that here; this messes up the Makefile process). Even WSL doesn't work, you'll need to use a virtual machine to build this on Windows. If your computer can't handle full Linux on a virtual machine, try running Ubuntu Server on a virtual machine, where the requirements are very low.
